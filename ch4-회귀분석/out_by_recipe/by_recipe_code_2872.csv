She probably has nothing to do with the actual post and just a blurb about the restaurant. Let alone the comments section, and will never see this 😝 I am going to hope she does see it !! ❤️


This turned out great! I did a few swap outs, because teenager 🙄😑 I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I 100% recommend putting soup over your rice, or grain of choice. I have made a few different versions over the years and found out (I’d say kind of the hard way) the first time I made it to separate the grain and soup! You really can’t store or re-heat it well with it added in during cooking. I got gloop instead of soup the next day!"

I had all the ingredients.... so the next day I made it and now it is a monthly dinner plus enough for MY lunch the next day! I did add a few splashes of .... worcestershire because that was something I remember my mom putting in her stuffed peppers &amp; with my eyes closed it was liked eating my mom&#39;s stuffed peppers! Amazing!!! To put a slice of American cheese on top of each bowl..... will blow your mind.... makes it creamy and delicious!  I am a picky eater.... so to find this recipe is the BEST!

I made only 1/2 of the recipe to make sure that it would be one that I truly like.  Like others, I added the white rice to each bowl first, then topped it with the soup and mixed it in.  I wanted to avoid the common complaint that the rice expanded and got gummy as it sat in the refrigerator.  The only change I would make is add more green pepper and reduce the amount of fluid.  I cooked this on the stove for a couple of hours, adding fluid as needed.  I used beef broth and a bit of water, and only 1 beef bouillon cube."

Everything else was the same as the recipe written here. I say that because the recipe published in the magazine in 1996 did not call for any water at all. Why does the website recipe say to add 2quarts of water? Did the restaurant notify the magazine after it came out that they had forgotten to include it in their recipe when they sent it in?

I did read through the reviews before making and decided to make some adjustments of my own. I started off by cooking the green peppers with 1lb of ground beef (not 2), which I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, and a little seasoning and kosher salt. I also used beef stock instead of water and cut it back to about 46.5oz (1 32oz box container and one 14.5oz can) instead of 2 quarts. My family and I like a thicker consistency with our soups so I added a little at a time, making sure it was just right. I also used 3c of (cooked) instant brown rice (that&#39;s what I had in the pantry) since another review recommended it! This soup turned out way better than expected and my SO says it&#39;s definitely a keeper! I also liked the idea of serving it with bread so I added Hawaiian Sweet Rolls to our meal! Yummy!"

I also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and added 1 tablespoon of dried basil and 1 teaspoon each of dried rosemary and thyme.  We topped it with shredded extra sharp cheddar and had crusty French bread on the side.  It was extremely filling and fairly healthy.

I also used 4 cans of vegetable broth instead of the water and bouillon. I did make it with 2 cups of cooked brown rice in the pot the entire time and it was fine. Great recipe! My family loved it!

The flavors were awesome.  Also, I used 1 lb. ground round, 1/4 lb. sweet Italian sausage and about 1/3 lb. of left over meatloaf and brown rice.  Definitely a make-again recipe."

My kids don&#39;t like stuffed peppers but they love this. I&#39;ve served it in bread bowls made from dough using my bread machine and then baked. I don&#39;t cook the rice beforehand. I put 1 Cup uncooked rice and 2 Cups extra water in the last 20 minutes of  simmering. Turns out great. I also subbed chicken bouillon for the beef &#39;cause that&#39;s what I had on hand. Delicious, hearty soup =)"

It was WAY too spicy! I&#39;ll try it again without the chilies and hope it&#39;s not so spicy. Will definitely make again though.

I did substitute about 4 oz of sausage and used ground round instead of ground beef.  I also used both green &amp; red peppers.  It is a lovely dinner soup!
