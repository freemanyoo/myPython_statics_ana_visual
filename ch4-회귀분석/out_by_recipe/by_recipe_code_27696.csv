I am not even a big meat eater, but I have made this pot roast TWICE in the past month.  I hate salty food, and I didn&#39;t find this this salty at all.  I only made one roast, and slid a few chopped up potatoes, carrots, onions, and garlic cloves under it (to make it all fit in my 4 quart crockpot).  I also added 1/4 cup of water to the recipe (because I love the gravy)!  My family likes the beef (which totally falls apart) and potatoes, while I favor the gravy and carrots.

I was still skeptical even as I mixed the packets together to pour over the meat. But one taste put all skepticism to rest. I made gravy from the juices and it was delicious.

I also thickened it with a slurry of flour and water. It turned out delicious. The only thing I would do differently is leave out the onion. For some reason, I am not too pleased with the taste of onions in all the slow cooker recipes I have tried. This is delicious though.
