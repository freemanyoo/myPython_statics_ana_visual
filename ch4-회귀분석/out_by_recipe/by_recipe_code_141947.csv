I added more to my serving because, as the saying goes, &#34;you can always add more, but you can&#39;t take it out.&#34;  This was as easy to make as presented.  I did separate my portions in the baking pan (which added a couple minutes only), and this make serving easier.  The sandwiches baked up warm and tasty.  I gave it 4/5 stars because my husband found the &#34;sweet/savory&#34; too sweet.  I will definitely make again but use less brown sugar."

I didn’t enjoy the horseradish flavor. Just a personal preference, but next time I’ll use mayo instead. I doubled the sauce &amp; used a pkg of 8 sweet rolls. I had to put 2 of them in a pan all by themselves, which turned out to be a happy accident because it left more space around them for the sauce to caramelize so when you cut to separate them, more of the thin, crispy-chewy sauce stuck around the edges. So you got more of the savory-sweet chewy toffee for each sandwich. Next time I make them, I’ll bake fewer in each pan so this will happen to all of them."

The sauce that you pour over the sandwiches is amazing.  I had to tweak it a little bit for picky people in my house - didn&#39;t use horshradish and substituted spicy brown mustard and used dijon.  This was delicious!  I was in a crunch for time to make these so I put them in at 350 for 20 minutes.  They were perfect!!!  Definitely would make these for a family get-together.

At all !! All the 5 star ratings fooled me. The horseradish taste like how it sound. It has a very strong taste and is spicy. I would make this again with all the other ingredients.

I like that you can&#39;t mess this up and soooo tasty. My husband preferred his hot and would nuke his for about 30 seconds on high. Good hot or cold. I used a large serrated knife to cut through and had no problems.

I have made many versions of these over the past  year and my daughter said these were the best she&#39;s had yet. I followed Gail&#39;s suggestions (review from April 8, 2020) and broke the buns apart and topped each one with Ham and Cheese. It was a little more time consuming but well worth it.

I always make a double batch for parties and potlucks.  One batch just as the recipe says.  The other batch I skip the horseradish and put a tiny smear of apricot, peach or marmalade jam on the bottom bun.  Leave out the onion in the butter sauce topper and use sesame seeds to differentiate between the two versions.  Both are huge hits!  Be sure to cut the ham and cheese to &#34;roll size&#34; before you put them together as it mskes them so much easier to cut for serving after they&#39;re baked.  Some vidros on the internet call for jyst laying large whole slices of ham overlapping on the bottom buns.  But then there&#39;s a huge mess when you try to cut them apart after baking. Avoid it by having the ham and cheese fit on the individual buns to start with!"

I didn’t have any poppyseeds so left those out and I couldn’t find any horseradish “spread” at my local grocery store so I used just the tiniest pinch of regular prepared horseradish on the bottom of each bun. I also could only let them sit in the fridge for about an hour before we needed to eat lunch that day. My teenage daughter who is THE pickiest eater on planet Earth loved them. Tomorrow night I am making a double batch of the sauce and pouring it over baked chicken breasts for a quick and easy dinner. I’m also planning on making the sauce and pouring it over plain Hawaiian rolls and baking them at Easter for a quick and easy and DIFFERENT side for Easter dinner! The sauce is the Boss lol! Soooooo tasty!

The printed recipe says it makes 12 rolls, but it calls for an 18 oz package of rolls, an 18 ounce package of rolls has 18 rolls.

Onion Powder because we don&#39;t like onions.  I&#39;ve let it sit over night and I&#39;ve made them an hour after making them.  They are best when left to sit over night but still good if made sooner than that as well.  I haven&#39;t had so many people ask for my recipe in a long time, they are so unique and SO GOOD, YUM!"

We were in a hurry, so I didn&#39;t let them sit, plus I used regular large hamburger rolls and they still got (unsolicited!) compliments from my family. Next time I might try planning ahead and let them sit overnight."

I reduced the horsehadish to 1/4 cup.  There was no way I could fit 12 sandwiches into a 8x8 pan so I made 15 and put into a 9x13 pan and it worked out great.  I only added a little additional ingredients for the marinade which turned out perfect!

I made them for our Christmas party this year and our guests raved over them.  They will definitely become a standard on our party menu!  I doubled the recipe and mistakenly didn&#39;t double the sauce, but it made so much, it was a happy accident!  I wouldn&#39;t have wanted double the amount of sauce.  Thank you for a FABULOUS recipe!"

I have people over after evening church services a lot during the year, and these have always been a huge hit.  My recipe; however, doesn&#39;t call for horseradish which is a good thing since I don&#39;t really care for it.  ;-)      Instead of Swiss cheese, I sometimes use gouda which melts so well."

I took them to a pot luck and had to sweep in and grab the last one quickly so that I could try it.  All the different flavors come together really well.  I didn&#39;t use quite as much horseradish sauce as suggested and it still packed plenty of punch.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The sandwiches were surprisingly not messy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

For a little neater eating, I added the onion mixture to the inside of the sandwiches, and wrapped them in foil to bake. I have some extras so I froze them before baking and can only assume they&#39;ll be just as good when thawed. Thanks for the recipe."

I like the idea of  the Hawaiian rolls along with the horseradish sauce.  It puts a nice kick on the recipe.  I will make this recipe again.

Being pressed for time, I did not let the sandwiches sit with the onions on top. I used the large sandwich size Hawaiian buns. I made the caramelized onions (but omitted the poppy seeds) and put them ON the sandwich, on top of the cheese. I wrapped the sandwiches in foil and baked them for 30 minutes. My husband is not a big ham eater and he said these were great; he loved the flavors together. This will be a recipe I&#39;ll make again and again."
