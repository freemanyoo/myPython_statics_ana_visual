It was exactly like the peanut butter fudge they used to serve in the school kitchen when I was little.  Soooooo good!  At Debbie on Nov 3, 2018... The butter is used to grease the pan in step 1.  At Susan11160 on Apr 24, 2018... Maybe you should give the recipe a try before giving it such a poor rating.  The marshmallow fluff gives the fudge a soft, slightly fluffy texture and is not at all gross.  I&#39;m not fond of thick, dense, hard fudge.  This definitely is NOT thick and dense or hard... it&#39;s nice and soft and fluffy."

I read previous reviews before trying this one. The problem with a lot of recipes is lack of details. Have your marshmallow creme jar open, and your peanut butter - I used Jif No Stir Natural Creamy Peanut Butter. already measured out. Prep your pan before you start. I line a 7&#34;x10&#34; glass pan lined with parchment. You must first bring the milk (I used evaporated milk) and sugar to a full boil - one that does not go away when stirred. I usually start with medium-high to get the boil going, then back off to medium once it&#39;s boiling.  You must stir constantly. Begin your 3 minute timing once the mixture comes to a full boil. Take the pan off the heat! I immediately stirred in a tsp of vanilla. Now you&#39;ve got to work quickly. Add your peanut butter and marshmallow creme.  Stir with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined. Pour into your prepared pan. Let it cool completely at room temperature. To cut it, just lift it our with the parchment paper and place it on your cutting surface. Cut into 1&#34; squares because it&#39;s quite rich. LOVE this recipe! Plenty of peanut butter flavor for me."

I changed when I started timing my boil time the second time and the fudge was perfect.When you time for the 3 minutes DO NOT start timing at a full boil. I did this the first time and my fudge was very dry and crumbly.Start timing for your 3 minutes as soon as it starts to boil. I removed from heat after the 3 minutes of boil before I added the marshmallow fluff and peanut butter.I only had a 13 oz jar of fluff and measuring out 7 oz was  a pain. I highly suggest buying the 7 oz jar if possible.Good luck!
