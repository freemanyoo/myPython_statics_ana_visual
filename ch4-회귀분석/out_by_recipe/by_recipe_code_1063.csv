However, I have a suggestion for all baking followers....I made a journal regarding measurements of all kinds.  Start weighing your ingredients, everything.. from fruit to nuts??.  You will be very surprised at the differences of volume.  Example one cup of flour is 4-1/4 ounces, bisquick, and bread flour is also 4-1/4 ounces per cup. A large banana is approx 4.8 ounces...1/4 cup of brown sugar is 2.0 ounces, same for granulated...Just a few examples.  Over the years we have used way too much ingredients that changed the recipe..hence the differences of people’s results.  Happy  Baking everyone????????"

Batter mixes up well and bakes quickly in the sheet cake pan.  Frosting is tasty, but does not have as strong of a cream cheese flavor as recipes made without the added butter this one has.  The cake is relatively moist and has a nice texture, but without any spices, it tastes a bit bland.  I  will make this again, but will add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg  to give it a bit of a boost in flavor."

To begin, I used Country Crock Olive Oil Plant Butter.  I only had 1 cup of white sugar, so to substitute I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar (not packed), and a scant cup of chocolate chips. While still warm I drizzled with my own cardamom glaze, made of butter, milk, powdered sugar, vanilla and ground cardamom (I am not a fan of cream cheese frosting). This was not my first time making these, but the above changes elevated this recipe to a whole new level."

I also make a glaze for top (1 cup Powdered Sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla plus couple dashes of nutmeg). I baked it in a glass 15X10 baking dish at 325 for about 30 min. Glaze was sufficient for that size."

I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and the confectioners sugar to 3 cups - turned out delicious.  Next time I&#39;d cut the sugar in the frosting in half - that would be sweet enough.  This one&#39;s a keeper.

I only made half the frosting and added that to some store bought cream cheese frosting that I already had in the frig. and also only used 1 cup powdered sugar.
