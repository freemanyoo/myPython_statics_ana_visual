It came out great. a couple of comments may be helpful. First, my batter was way more than required for 2 4x8 pans. I used 3 pans. Second, even with  3 pans a whole cup of nuts on top was too much. I should have put 1 1/2 cups of nuts in the batter and a 1/2 cup for sprinkling on top. I did 2 with glaze and 1 without. I definitely liked the glaze.  Letting the bread completely cool is important to allow it to set. It is too crumbly when you try to cut it while still warm."

I use walnuts instead of pecans and I mix them in completely instead of saving half for the top. The orange glase is just right to set off the banana flavor. Thank you for this recipe.

I add 1 tsp banana extract and reduce the sugar to 1 cup.  To release the bread from the pans, I place wax paper to fit the bottom.  Grease the wax paper and sprinkle cinnamon/sugar on the paper.  Don&#39;t grease the sides so that the batter can rise to its maximum.  While the pans are still warm, not hot, run a knife along the sides, turn out the loaves on a cooling rack.

It turned out really great, I made 12 muffins and one loaf of bread. It was perfect the muffins were better than the bread because of the cooking time I think. I did add cinnamon sugar mix to the batter and sprinkled it on top with the pecans, I reduced the pecans by 1/2 cup though. And it was fabulous!!! For the glaze I just added milk instead of the orange juice to the glaze."

I LOVE it but can&#39;t enjoy as often as I&#39;d like due to the high calorie/fat content.

In the 13 years I&#39;ve been married, my husband has never eaten banana bread. However, when I had him try this, he was shocked at how good it was. Everytime I turn around, he&#39;s getting another slice. The kids absolutely love it and I swear it&#39;s the best thing I&#39;ve made in years. Throwing away the other banana bread recipes because none of them compare. We leave out the nuts, but it doesn&#39;t take away from the end result. The texture and the glaze truly make this banana bread unforgettable."

Used the correct sized pans but the loaves wouldn&#39;t bake--it took about an hour and a half and then the tops burned--they looked too full as I was filling the pans up.  Should I have used 3 pans?</p>
