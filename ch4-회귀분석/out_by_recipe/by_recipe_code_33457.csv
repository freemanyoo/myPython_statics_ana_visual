My family asks me to make it every October. The cinnamon flavor and chunks of apple make it delicious! I serve it with the yummy caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream. This sweet dessert gets 5 stars.

Next, there are a few speedboats you hit while making. For example, the batter is VERY thick. Honestly, it&#39;s more the consistency of cookie dough. Dont try to use a hand mixer on this, it will break (been there, done that). The reason for that, though, is all the liquid that is in the apples will cook out and mix with the batter while baking. It&#39;s supposed to be like that.

Next, it is VERY sweet if you use anything other than a tart apple; I always go straight for the big granny smiths. Anything else just adds together to make a sugary overload.

Last, the end result is a very moist, very heavy cake. Best if eaten quickly, even better if warm. It will not last more than a couple of days!

Pairs beautifully with some vanilla ice-cream, cinnamon, and caramel (never actually used the butterscotch sauce part of the recipe, never felt it was the right kind of flavor). Makes for a fantastic breakfast or dessert, and it&#39;s perfect for those cool autumn nights and brisk winter mornings."

I used  close to 5 cups of chopped apples and it still seemed like a lot.

I wouldn&#39;t change a thing, except that with my oven I needed about 10 minutes more baking time. Oh, and I used 4 different types of apples (Granny Smith, jazz, pink lady, and braeburn). As others have stated, the batter was indeed quite stiff, but my little Sunbeam mixer could still handle it. When it was time to stir in the apples, the fruit-to-batter ratio was very high; no wonder this cake is so incredibly moist! Speaking of which?don?t worry if the surface of your cake is hard and crusty when it comes out of the oven. After it?s mostly cooled, cover it with foil and it will resolve itself shortly to become uniformly moist and tender. As with most cakes, it&#39;s better the second day. I think the cake stands on its own without the sauce, but that punch of sweetness is a nice treat. I added a few drops of butter-rum extract, just for fun. I will make this sauce again for other things (ice cream, or a dip for apples, for example). Five stars!"

Great for pot lucks if you can keep the delicious sauce warm and top just as you serve it.  I tried putting it on top and cutting later, but makes it very soggy if it sits too long.  It is the best and yes the I wondered when I made the batter if it would cook up correctly as it didn&#39;t seem to have enough liquid.  But as others have state, the apples have a lot of moisture and the cake turns out wonderful.  This is a keeper and we will have at Thanksgiving time."
