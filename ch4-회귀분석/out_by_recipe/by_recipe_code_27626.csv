I have been known to make the meat and veggie mixture - in multiples of the amount in this recipe -  in a Dutch oven so I can freeze some for later use. Have also added mushrooms, fresh (preferably) or canned.

I always use Yukon Gold potatoes to make mashed potatoes with--it really ratchets up the flavor.  I do think, as another reviewer stated, that the meat/veggie mixture needed some salt added before the potatoes were spread on top.   Update--9/21/2017:  I am scheduled for foot surgery soon and cannot stand for long periods of time SO I made this even quicker.  For the sauce, I used Campbell&#39;s Beefy Mushroom soup with some sour cream added and for the potatoes, I made very thick instant ones with some of the sour cream added.

So the ingredient to use typically depends on which contry your from. In the US is typically beef.See from Wikipedia: In early cookery books, the dish was a means of using leftover roasted meat of any kind, and the pie dish was lined with mashed potato as well as having a mashed potato crust on top.[7][8]The term &#34;shepherd&#39;s pie&#34; did not appear until 1854, and since then it is sometimes used synonymously with &#34;cottage pie&#34;, regardless of whether the principal ingredient is beef or mutton. In the United Kingdom, the term &#34;shepherd&#39;s pie&#34; is typically used when the meat is lamb. ]"

First, I didn&#39;t put all of the veggies in because it looked like way too much.  I also didn&#39;t put in as much onion and instead added some chopped celery.  Because others stated it was a bit lacking in flavor, I added some parsley, basil, and steak rub seasoning.  I also used store-bought mashed potatoes.At the end I stuck it all in a dish, and put it in the oven at 350deg for about 15 minutes.  Next time I will also broil it for a couple minutes too, like others suggested.One thing I did notice was a distinct sweetness to it.  I think it was a combination of the ketchup and the large amount of corn.  Next time I will cut down on the corn and add in a different veggie (maybe broccoli).  While the sour cream made the &#34;sauce&#34; taste good, I didn&#39;t really get a strong sour cream flavor (info for those who are on the fence about adding in the sour cream).Overall, a good dish, and pretty quick when using leftover or store-bough mashed potatoes.

I used some leftover beef roast, about 2/3 bag of frozen mixed veg medley, almost a whole jar of turkey gravy with some generous splashes of Worcestershire sauce, some leftover mash, and some crunched up tater tots (to make up for my small amount of mash). I layered on some processed cheese, you know, the kind that comes in a 2# loaf, and just left it to bubble away. My husband declared it &#34;some really good comfort food&#34;, which was perfect after the crummy, rainy day we had.  So, please forgive me, reviewer purists out there. For everyone else, I&#39;ll just say this recipe is very forgiving. It&#39;s hard to go too wrong with a combo of beef, veggies and potatoes, especially when you only have to wash one pan.

Used two cans of mixed veggies that I had on hand and added extra beef broth to make a bit more sauce.  Absolutely outstanding.  This will be my go-to meal for families that need a meal from church.  Other reviews have said it freezes well, so I&#39;m hoping to make up several and have them on hand!  Thank you."

Whenever she says &#34;it&#39;s a 5-star keeper&#34;, I know she loves it. She even asked for seconds, which is most unusual. Because I didn&#39;t have any leftover mashed potatoes, I prepared a full bag of Ore-Ida Steam and Mash Russet potatoes. I used 2 packets of low-sodium beef broth because she&#39;s on a low-sodium diet. I used a tad less Worcester sauce, and increased the amount of low-sodium ketchup. but the flavor was still GREAT!

I changed a few things: I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon, and I didn&#39;t have Worcestershire sauce so I replaced it with BBQ and hot sauce. Past Shepherd&#39;s Pie recipes have been extremely bland so I think the BBQ sauce and hot sauce actually made the recipe more enjoyable for us."
