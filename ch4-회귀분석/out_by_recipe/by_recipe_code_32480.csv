Within a day or so after being made it is dry and very sad tasting.  Does anyone else have this same thing happen? I love the the easiness of this recipe and hope there are some suggestions on how I might get the moist taste you get from some of the store bought white breads."

This website is less clickbait than the other top of google bread recipes. 

The bread comes out good, if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center. My girlfriend says it’s too salty so I’m trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt. I thought the salt was fine but I want her to eat the bread too so, less salt. And I tried it with honey instead of sugar, but it didn’t look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar. The yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but wasn’t bubbling, so I put sugar in there with the honey too. I will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time. 

This recipe is a good baseline to go off of and you’ll probably want to make adjustments to your taste."

Dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan, but not over, otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan.   Carrie, sugar is the simplest of the &#39;starches&#39; that yeast needs to form, you can use honey or even corn starch,  sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest.  if you use honey or starch it will take longer.  if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour, that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour.  Remember not to put yeast into too hot of liquid mix or it make kill it."

This Recipe yielded me The Very Best Loaves of Bread I have Ever Made. The thing I done Different this time was I used ALL BREAD FLOUR. Historically I used All Purpose Flour. While my Bread always turned out Well, the Crust was very Hard and the Bread was Dense, but I never had any Leftovers. This Recipe and using BREAD FLOUR my Bread Top was Soft and my Bread was Light as it is from The Grocery Store. I was Amazed but I Recommend Trying This Recipe and Use Bread Flour Only. After it comes out of The Oven, Brush the Tops with Melted Butter. I hope You Enjoy Making Your Bread and that it Turns Out Perfectly As Mine Did.

Easy even if you are so so at following directions. I left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo. Not too many bubbles for me on the yeast either, but again, turned out like the photo. I baked 35 minutes. The hollow sound didn&#39;t sound hollow to me, it sounded dense to me but then again I don&#39;t know what to listen for as an amateur. Either way, it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part. This really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture, talk about diluting the mixture with garbage! The store bread you pay $2 or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality. It is worth way less than that and I made this quality bread for about 1.66  per batch . 83 cents per loaf at 33 cents for yeast, 2.50 for 5 lb bag flour, divided., at 3 1/3 cups per pound, using 6 1/4 cups. You could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isn&#39;t necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make A LOT of bread before the yeast expires. I&#39;d experiment by putting Everything Seasoning on the top of it, Caraway seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seed pits, the list goes on. The bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty, not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap! Good luck! Youtube: LCatRN"

Tip since yeast is the new toilet paper during this virus find a local bake shop and ask them is you can buy some yeast I found fresh and it had expired and worked beautifully just proof it like active dry yeast. Cheer and good luck.

Thank you to Steve for the suggestion regarding flour, started out with 6 cups and added as needed/kneaded ended up with the whole 6 3/4 cups.  The only thing I did different was I used a couple of tips I had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work.  The first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave, starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110-115 deg f., then add yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar.  While mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f. then turn off and allow to cool slightly, then put the dough in there to raise (door closed). I use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans I covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking.  I haven&#39;t had an issue with dough rising since I started using this method, as long as yeast is before &#34;best by&#34; date."

Making bread is not an exact science.  The amount of flour you use isn&#39;t going to exactly match what is in this recipe.  (or any recipe)  The amount varies depending on temperature and humidity.  If it&#39;s cool and/or dry in your house, you will use less flour.  You will have to adjust by feel and texture as you knead the dough.  Don&#39;t add all the flour at once.   It also helps to have a small pan with some water on the rack below the bread pan.  This adds additional humidity while you bake the bread. (Giving a nicer crust)"

Reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be 1 cup of water to 2 cups of flour per loaf of bread.  Oil can be higher ratio.   The bread when it rises will create its own heat.  SO if you have dry flower that is why... change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs.

As an experienced baker, I can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic. To answer some other concerns, it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes. This fully activated the yeast and can improve results. To the person whose bread came out doughy, have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate? Often, home ranges can vary in actual temperature."

All the crap you buy there and most of the flour mixes have bromate. SO I finally decided to buy bromate free flour and try to cook..(( wait is it took or make or make??) Make bread. It was easier than I thought it would be to make.. Its rising right now.. Kinda huge.. I realized though that I don&#39;t have any bread pans so.. this is going to be an interesting experiment... Going to toss it on a cookie sheet and.. eat what happens.   I like that the recipe was so easy. I don&#39;t like the ads I have to scroll through in the middle of the page.   I&#39;ll try this again next week.. I think

I bake a lot of fancy breads and thought I would give this a go and it came out fine. I also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves. It had a nice crust and the bread itself had a nice &#39;sopping up&#39; power with my tomato based sauce. It was a little heavier than store bought, mass produced, &#39;half-baked&#39; store bought garbage, but that is obviously to be expected. We went through both in less than 2 days. I&#39;d make it again.   For those having issues, following directions is key. Use bread flour. Be patient. Put away your bread machine. Temp your water. Let the starter work. Don&#39;t use too much flour....only what it needs. (You probably won&#39;t need all 6 cups) If this isn&#39;t taking you a good 3-4 hours to make, you&#39;re doing it wrong."

I forgot to grease the top of the bread, but that didn&#39;t seem to affect it much. also, for those curious, you can definitely replace canola oil with olive oil, and regular sugar with brown sugar, or truvia brown sugar blend if that&#39;s all you have. if using truvia blend, make sure to follow the sugar to truvia conversion in the back of the bag.! thanks so much for this awesome recipe, will try making these on a weekly basis and see if i can save money on store bought bread!"

I&#39;ve used rapid rise yeast that&#39;s close to 8 months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly.  However, if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line, that could kill it long before the expiration date.  Dissolving it in water that&#39;s too hot will do it in too.  Best to have the water 105? to 110?.  If you set it  out to rise is in a cold room, that will prevent any rising.  I warm the oven a bit before I start and turn it off after a minute or so when it&#39;s around 100?.  That seems to work well for rising.  If the dough doesn&#39;t rise even after it&#39;s set in the oven to bake, then the yeast was dead."

The second time I used 1/4 cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar. Dissolved the sugar and then added the yeast. Cover the yeast and let it set for 10 minutes until frothy. After that I added the rest of the ingredients and kneeded the living carp out of it. Everything turned out perfect this time. Light, fluffy, and yeasty. It was delicious. Just active the yeast in this way and it will turn out fine."

However, I feel like it has some important steps left out that you need to know if you&#39;re not an experienced bread Baker. First of all - to activate your yeast - you need to put the warm water and yeast and sugar alone in your bowl. Stir it well, cover it, and set it aside when it&#39;s frothy looking - those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go. THEN add all the other ingredients. Otherwise it&#39;s a great basic recipe. Make sure to work the dough long enough - I do half with a dough hook and my KitchenAid and half by hand on a flour dusted counter. It needs to feel really smooth and stretchy. Good luck! It tastes delicious and a perfect texture!"

I&#39;ve made this recipe more than once -- several times at high elevation in Denver, another time at/near sea level in Houston.  I never leave reviews for recipes, but felt the need to pay it forward on this one.  PRO TIP (based on experience and experimentation): use UNBLEACHED bread flour if you want a softer crust.  I&#39;ve used standard, all-purpose bleached flour, but the crust ends up too hard.  It&#39;s almost too difficult to cut through it in the end.  I much prefer the softer crust.  As for the rest of the recipe, follow it.  It&#39;s perfect.  I mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and, literally, a regular fork.  Yes, my arm begins to ache by the time I&#39;ve added the 4th cup of flour.  Also, if you are a bread-baking newbie like I was, I used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the 1st and 2nd rise. "

I don&#39;t even need to adjust the baking time, they turn out beautifully every time. As for the amount of flour, I think the recipe is only showing you what you will need before you start, like say you only need 5 cups of flour for the bread, what happens if you only have that much flour? You can&#39;t knead the bread so well cuz you ran out, I tested how much I end up using after my dough is ready to be kneaded, and I use almost another whole cup of flour."

I used 5 1/4 cups of flour instead of the 6 1/4 to 6 3/4 cups it calls for. I found that the recommended amount of flour was just entirely too much. I also used vegetable oil instead of canola, because that&#39;s all I had.This bread is wonderful! My husband, son and mother ate a whole loaf in  two hours! The other loaf is almost gone today.It is so moist and soft. I can&#39;t believe it turned out this good! I made everyone french toast this morning and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch.
