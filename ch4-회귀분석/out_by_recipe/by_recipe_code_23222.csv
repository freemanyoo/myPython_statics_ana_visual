I did add a few things which is very much what I always seem to do. First, I didn&#39;t have the chicken breast, so I used the chicken thighs. I didn&#39;t skin or debone them, I used them as they were, just made sure I cooked them long enough. Second, I also added some seasonings to the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, &amp; Italian seasoning along with S&amp;P. Third, to the broth I added the juice of one lemon. Right now I seem to have a lot of lemons and I like using them whenever I can, they seem to brighten the flavor. Because there is only the two of us this recipe has given me two nights worth of dinners (&#34;cook once, eat twice&#34;)."

Following ideas from other reviewers, I sliced my large chicken breasts (2) in half. That worked well.  I also added 1/4 C white wine to the sauce, and the little remaining flour left after dredging the breasts to thicken it a little. I was heavy on the mushrooms, cause we love them.  I added some snipped fresh rosemary and chives to the sauce because we love fresh herbs.  I served over zucchini noodles and asparagus that were sautéed in olive oil, garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  It was delightful.  The only change I will make next time is to double the sauce.  We would have enjoyed more over our &#34;zoodles&#34;.   Would serve this to company!"

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly other than upgrading by using portobello mushrooms. Procedure-wise: I sliced two 8-oz. chicken breasts lengthwise rather than pound them to 1/4&#34; thickness. Doing that saved a little effort and it did not at all impact the taste. This recipe can make a novice cook look like a seasoned pro. It was flavorful, juicy and the two of us could have easily eaten the other two servings. :)  I will definitely be making this again.  I liked the idea shared in the reviews of sauteing the onions. I&#39;m also toying with the idea of using half chicken broth and half white wine for the sauce mixture.  To answer &#34;Lousey Cook in Texas&#39; question: I don&#39;t know that it would taste as good as making it fresh. The breading on the chicken might get a bit soggy. You could try it but it really doesn&#39;t take long to put this all together."
