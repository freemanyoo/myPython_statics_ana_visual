I just needed to crush up a few more oreos for the crust to fill the bottom of the pan.  I normally don&#39;t adjust recipes prior to making them the first time but several people commented about the sweetness of this dessert so I only added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese/peanut butter mixture and none to the chocolate pudding.  This was perfect for us!  Everyone at the party loved it!  I&#39;d definately make it again.

I used the new peanut butter filled Oreos for the base and to sprinkle on top and that really put it over the top.  I also found a big jar of truly miniature peanut butter cups (about the size of a large chocolate chip) at our local Mennonite store and used those rather than chopping up peanut butter cups.  A wonderful cool treat on a very hot summer day!

I kno i will make (and be asked to make) it again.Its super crazy sweet tho. I will leave the powdered sugar out altogether in the future. I put about a cup in with the cream cheese only bc i had sugar free pb... Its still borderline too sweet tho.We used the butterfinger bits instead of the reeses too.And a little tip for the oreos... I used an already made oreo pie crust for that. It holds together better to spread the cream chesse on top. I just dumped it in the bottom of the casserole dish i used and sorta smashed it down to cover the whole bottom.Still ridiculously good for 10 mins of work!

One thing I ••didn&#39;t••do was follow the recipe to a T. when I read the ingredients it sounded way too sweet (it was going to have a cloying affect). reading all the reviews I found others thought so too after they had made it. decided to cut the powdered sugar in half. didn&#39;t add powdered sugar to the pudding either. Also a change I made was to cut some of the sweetness by adding some creme fresh  to the cream cheese. Another thing I did was melted the butter and I broke up the cookies more fine like a pie crust. I knew if I added the melted butter to the cookie crumbs I&#39;d be able to pat it better into the bottom of my container. I put it in the refrigerator overnight because I plan on serving this to my coworkers for the next few days. also omitted putting the cookie chunks and/or the minI peanut butter cups on top because I didn&#39;t know how well it would travel on a plane and the top treats would just get squashed plus seemed like overkill.my husband was able to just have one bite last night (and a small bite at that) because his stomach was on fire from Mexican restaurant  we went to for dinner. he did say this was very good. I actually think I&#39;ll make this several more times. I wish I would&#39;ve known about it last weekend at our 3yr old&#39;s birthday party but I didn&#39;t. all in all I think this is a hit.dinged a point because of original recipe being too sweet for our taste as written plus additions&amp;subtractions.PS....UPDATE: July 1stmade it again yesterday for a neighbor who is having a 1st time swim/pool filling up party tonight. I use the 5.9oz pudding mix because I want to make it a large dessert for this US celebration weekend party. I crushed &#39;chocolate colored rock candy&#39; on top for color (from WinCo bulk dept). I won&#39;t be here for the party tonight, but hope it will be enjoyed. (ask if you care to know how I changed this recipe to suit our tastes, happy to oblige)."
