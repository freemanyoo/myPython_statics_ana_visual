Never once until today have I read that the whites should be whipped until stiff. Mine have always turned out perfectly just by using an manual egg whipper. I found that adding an additional 2-3 Tbls. of flour reduced the looseness of the batter. I personally like a cakier macaroon. 
I also use coconut extract instead of vanilla. That change made all the difference in a just so so cookie to a great one.
A couple of Christmases I got a phone call from a complete stranger in P.A. who had eaten some of these macaroons I had sent to former neighbor of mine. She was calling to ask for my recipe!"

Rather than going by volume - I went by weight, using a single package that weighed 7 oz. 

With this, I scaled up the amount of each ingredient - 1/2 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, 3/4ths tsp of vanilla, and three egg whites. The result was a puffy, toasty cookie that didn&#39;t spread. I had to bake it a bit longer at 325 as well - maybe set an 18-20 minute timer and check to see if the tops are toasty."

It never ceases to amaze me how people can supposedly follow the same recipe with such different results.  Toll house cookies being the prime example.  Anyway, sorry, I did change it a little.  I have made macaroons before and just wanted to experiment--however, I didn&#39;t change any measurements just tweaked things a little.  I used almond flour, rum instead of vanilla, added some candied ginger and a dark chocolate button on top.  They&#39;re fabulous but I mainly wanted to mention how they came together.  They didn&#39;t but I piled them in heaps on the cookie sheet, anyway, and they&#39;re fine.  Also, this recipe with no change in amounts on the ingredients, made 23 big macaroons.  Macaroons are so rich and sweet and, basically unhealthy, most recipes don&#39;t recommend making them very big.  Can&#39;t figure out how people could think the recipe doesn&#39;t make enough.  Last of all, I think the freshness of the eggs makes a difference.  Staler egg whites are watery.  I could have used a little of that."

Once they cooled, I dipped the bottoms into melted chocolate, and when they set, I drizzled melted chocolate on top. They turned out beautifully!

I bake in Germany, so have two differences:  I used unsweeteed DRY coconut, and I bake on parchment. The mix was not overly sticky, so I could form small balls instead of using two spoons (probably due to the low moisture content of the coconut). They baked like a charm. I got 15 cookies from this recipe. I took them to my first Holiday party with my new company, and my boss inhaled them.

My egg whites were cold not room temperature (i was impatient ha)  and I whisked them with them with the vanilla.

The results are great either way. Whipped whites naturally give the macaroons a lighter and airier texture, versus being denser and chewier (my preference) when not whipped. If you can&#39;t be bothered, or if you just want a denser texture, don&#39;t whip the whites and the cookies will be just fine. Despite the pedantic naysaying of the pedantic naysayers."

I needed to bake them about 25 minutes to get a bit of golden color, but they came out EXACTLY as pictured and described. I have 36 beautiful and delicious macaroons to take to an event this evening.  I will definitely come back to this recipe.  I found these to be a little *too* sweet for my taste, so I&#39;ll try it with less sugar next time.  But I wanted to let others know that there is NO NEED to bother with whipping the egg whites.  I had a little trouble getting them off the first pan, but I think that&#39;s because I let them cool a little before transferring them to a wire rack.  For the second pan, I transferred them as soon as they came out of the oven, and it was no trouble at all.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because they were still hot and soft or because it was a different type of pan, but I&#39;ll transfer them immediately from now on.  GREAT RECIPE!"
