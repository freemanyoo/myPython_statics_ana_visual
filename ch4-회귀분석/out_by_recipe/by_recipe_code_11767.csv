I also like thyme with mushrooms and will probably use some heavy cream as the soup looks a little thin in the video.

The beauty of this recipe is it is delicious as is, but is also adaptable.  We, like so many others, begin with this basic recipe and enhance it to meet our specific tastes by sauteeing onions, carrots, celery, baby spinach, one minced clove of garlic, 1/8 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and one tablespoon of Madeira wine with the mushrooms before blending everything.   Before adding the cream, I put half of the blended mix into a freezer container and allow it to cool completely before freezing.  Then we have soup for one night in the weeks to come and I add cream and three sprigs of thyme to the inviting mix waiting in the pan."

It was simply delightful!! I halved the recipe because Im only cooking for one and I wanted leftovers for tomorrow. I did add a little bit more salt and pepper but that’s personal preference and I know many watch their sodium intake. This is DEFINITELY staying in rotation!! After tasting it I felt no need to add garlic or hot sauce or anything else. I love that mushroom taste and had no need to mask it. Thank you for an amazing recipe!!!</p>

It&#39;s half milk and half light cream. You could get the same effect with 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup light cream. That said, this recipe is not very flavorful. It needed garlic for a start, and one commenter suggested adding some sherry--any white wine would help. I added a couple of quick grates of nutmeg--be careful not to overdo this as a tiny bit goes a long way. A little bit of thyme would be a good idea, too. I added a dash of tabasco, maybe 1/16 to 1/8 of a tsp--not enough to add any heat, but it did help to open up the flavor"

I just wanted to make a comment in response to the information you shared about stock vs broth. I’m not sure what you’ve shared is accurate. It’s my understanding that both stock and broth are made from the bones, the difference is in the length of time they are cooked. Bone broth is cooked longer with the intention of leeching more nutrients from the bones. Chicken stock is more for flavour, where as broth is more for health benefits. I’m open to being challenged on this, just wanted to put forth a different perspective. Thanks."

My hubby needed something hearty but liquid and this did the trick.    I did read through the comments and did some changes.   First I started with crimini mushrooms.   When the onions and mushrooms were cooked I added crushed roasted garlic and dried thyme.   I also added a splash (1/4 cup) of sherry to the broth.    Let it boil for about 15min then added whipping cream, some more butter,  another &#34;splash&#34; of sherry and some fresh lemon juice.   Shimmered for about 1/2hr.  Pulled out a 1/2 cup of mushrooms,  then used the immersion blender to what it was in the pot.   Added back the mushrooms set aside.   Did add just a little cornstarch to thicken it a little bit more.   The extra cooking allowed the flavor to developed.  Definitely a keeper recipe."

Fir some reason I always thought mushroom soup was hard to make...well I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong.  Simple and the results are CROWD PLEASING!  I made it for a potluck and x4&#39;d the recipie. I also substituted corn starch for the flour..used less and my gluten free friends were also able to enjoy.

Doubled the recipe (meaning I doubled almost* every ingredient) because 1) hubby loves cream of mushroom soup, and 2) I had a lot of mushrooms I needed to use. *The only ingredient I didn&#39;t double was the flour. I also added cooking sherry (which works just fine).  I used 4 tbsp. butter, melted. Then added the onion and cooked for about 5 minutes. Then, the flour which I quickly stirred so it was almost a roux, but it was very dry, so that&#39;s when I tossed in about 1 tsp. or so of cooking sherry. Next I added 29 oz. of chicken broth (mixed of Swanson&#39;s organic and some homemade leftovers) and the mushrooms. I added some thyme because, in my world, pretty much every mushroom dish is a little bit better with thyme (for this I added about 1 tsp.) Then I let it simmer until the onions and mushrooms were soft. NOTE: I did NOT add salt.  When the onions and mushrooms were soft, I added a bit of the broth to a combo of 1/2 c. half"

I came back here to get a reminder of how to make it, and half-and-half is on the recipe. Doubted my memory and used the half and half. It was so unremarkably bland and THIN. Heavy Cream makes all the difference in the world. Possibly this recipe was tweaked since I saved it? Would rate it 3 stars as-is. Fine for a way to use up mushrooms, but nothing I would serve for a special meal. Use the original heavy cream if you want 5 stars.(previous review) I am trying to let the soup finish cooking, but can&#39;t help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove. I think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right. The mushrooms can&#39;t be plain white mushrooms. Their flavor is half the taste. I used CRIMan but would have loved to use portabella/baby bellas. I also used sweet onions. (Peruvian) I cannot imagine using white or yellow with this. admittedly I fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole, and it has plenty of onion flavor in it. Also, at the suggestion of a friend, I added a roux. Accidently made it very dark, but the toasted flavor was perfect. my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so I omitted salt and pepper. Simply amazing."

It was a little thin, next time I will add a little more flour.  I did make a roux with the flour first to cook it off and used baby bella mushrooms.  Will definitely make this again.   I did not taste any flour as some have."

I have made it several times both to eat on its own and to use in other recipes.  I too had problems with the flour taste and so I tried using corn starch and that solved the problem.  I actually think the overall texture of the soup is better using the corn starch.  This soup will be a staple in our household.  Delicious and healthy.

It was still a bit too much flour in the final taste.  I also added some toasted onion powder.  That helped cover up the flour flavor.   I&#39;ll definitely make this again, but I think I&#39;ll cut the flour in half."

The only change we will make in the future is to chop the mushrooms smaller.  We also added about 1-2 tbsp red wine while we sauteed the onions and mushrooms and it was outstanding.

I took the advice of a couple of reviewers and made a roux of the onion/butter mixture before adding the broth. There was no flour taste! I used more onion than called for and also used baby bella mushroom.  Hubby liked this soup and suggested a splash of sherry next time.  Will definitely make again.

Avoided the flour taste by:  Saute the onions in butter first.  Then add a couple more tbsp. of butter and add flour to that to make a roux (with onions in it).  Cook it for a few minutes to get rid of the flour taste.  If it&#39;s too thick to stir, add a bit more butter, then proceed to add your liquid. Sauteed the mushrooms in a separate pot while the onions were cooking.  Yeah, 2 dirty pans, but avoided the floury taste by cooking the roux."

I used a combo of types of mushrooms made a slurry of the mushroom mixture, flour and 2 cups of the chicken stock to cook out the flour taste.  Warmed the remaining stock and then added the slurry to the hot stock; stir often until thickened THEN add the cream and turn down to med/low and let simmer. A few extra steps but OH SO WORTH IT!"

All I could taste was the flour so anyone that makes this recipe should use less flour.  I might make this again but would defintely not use 6 TBS. of flour.  I think you need to experiment with this recipe to come up with the correct measurements.  I did go ahead and serve this but threw out the remainder.
