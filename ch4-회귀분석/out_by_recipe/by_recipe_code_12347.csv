My husband asked for it twice within the week after the cookout.  Great old tyme flavor.  Also makes a great dip for veggies and crackers.  I didn&#39;t have celery salt so I very finely minced a celery stalk and that was great.  A little extra crunch with a lot extra flavor!

I love the slightly  sharp edge that the Sour cream adds to this recipe. It seems to lighten up the heaviness that Mayonnaise can sometimes add to a recipe. Due to health issues I did not use any salt at all.  I used Celery Seed, and I  cut back  on the sugar. And to liven  it up even more some Cider Vinegar. Some freshly grinded Black Pepper completes this tasty side dish. One of our favorites during the summer.  I know my family is really going to enjoy this one.

I also cut down on the sugar ever so slightly (personal preference, not the recipe&#39;s fault).To make the slaw the star, we make tortillas on these hot summer nights, using this slaw, a tortilla wrap, and leftover grilled pork (though shrimp, fish, or chicken are all okay, too).Thanks for sharing this recipe.
