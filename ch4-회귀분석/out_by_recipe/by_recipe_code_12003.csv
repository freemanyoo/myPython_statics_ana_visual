It is in my Better Homes &amp; Gardens cookbook I received as a shower gift. Mine calls for tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and either ricotta or cottage cheese, not both. I have a lasagna pan which is a bit deeper than the traditional 9x13 and it fills the dish. Everyone loves it when I serve it."

I found the sauce to acidic from the tomato paste so I added more sugar and adjusted seasonings. There was plenty of meat sauce and so my 9x13 pan was filled to the top as described. I did use no boil noodles with excellent results.  The recipe turned out delicious. Why others didn&#39;t like it is just personal opinion. The recipe is a keeper.

That being said TOH altered my original submission of this recipe!  I don&#39;t do all those layers and use only 2 layers of noodles (6 total). I continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later! Isn&#39;t that what all cooks do as we learn?  One thing I will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results - like shred the mozzarella (preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and DOES affect the results). Also, don&#39;t use cheap ingredients (garbage in garbage out). If you use pre-processed ingredients don&#39;t blame the recipe!!   I recently found a true Italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made!  In regards to the sauce-I have learned that weather (like humidity) actually makes a difference. I purposely make a thick sauce so the layers &#34;stay in place&#34; as I dislike runny lasagne. Again, personal preference!  Thank you all for your comments and enjoy!!!"

A question to the author and readers.  I just caught today the recipe calls for 3   8 oz cans of sauce.  I had never noticed they were 8 oz cans and have been using the standard 15 1/2 . I  could not imagine this with less.  Was the 8 oz cans a typo or is that how everyone has been preparing?  Regardless of the answer I will stick to the 3 larger cans but I am curious.

So this is American Lasagna and it&#39;s delicious - it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be.  Lasagna comes from the Greeks - I actually make a Greek lasagna better known as Pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef  but when I want American Lasagna I make this recipe.   Did you know the Brits actually found a recipe for Lasagna from the 1390&#39;s?  Each country has perfected their own claim to Lasagna fame.  When the Italians make it in Northern Italy they do not use ricotta cheese, they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella.  Ricotta is used in the Southern region only, this is why many Italians in America use ricotta - most are descendants from Southern Italians.  So even Mario or Giada is making it wrong if you are from Tuscany."

I used 24 oz. pasta sauce with basil instead of plain tomato sauce. I also added 1t oregano. Used non-boil lasagna. Assembled everything a day ahead and cooked it 50 minutes and refrigerated it (covered tightly). The next day, I warmed it 20 minutes at 250 and 10 minutes at 350 until the edges bubbled a bit. It was a huge hit. Next time I will use real mozzarella cheese and shred it myself, but this time I didn&#39;t have the energy for that. I think it will make it a 6 star if it has real cheese instead of the prepacked shredded cheese, which has fillers. This photo is a bit deceptive. My pan was filled to the top."

Last night I served it to my dinner guests, and even the person who said he HATED lasagna ate a great big helping. This really does make a lot, so I suggest that you use a nice deep lasagna pan. I made some simple additions to suit our tastes: a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat, a 10 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms (drained), and I increased the sausage to one pound. I also increased the tomato sauce to 30 ounces. Extra mozzarella on every layer. Perfecto! Helpful hints: Add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesn&#39;t stick to the foil. And in response to several questions about the sausage, recommendations are to use ground Italian sausage, NOT pork breakfast sausage or sausage links. I made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time I made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it. Yikes"

Today I added a little chicken broth to loosen it up a bit. It wasn&#39;t soupy!!!! The seasonings I changed up a bit too, in addition to Italian I used a complete sazon seasoning, and adobo.

The rest I followed exactly.  I let it rest for about 1 hour, before cutting into it and just reheated pieces in the microwave.

However, I am confused. I went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients. If you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone; then when you get to step 3 you are supposed to layer with provolone. Provolone is similar to mozzarella, but the instructions call for provolone AND mozzarella. Note the recipe also calls for 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese. No where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned. Finally, the sauce is to be simmered for one hour. Unless you want it burned, don&#39;t plan on that. It is very thick and I had to stop with nine minutes to go. Obviously this recipe was not kitchen-tested."

I only use one can of tomato paste I feel that when you use two it has too much of a metallic taste (especially when eating leftovers) and it also makes the sauce too thick and reheated leftovers are too dry.  I also use slightly more tomato sauce and use two 15 oz cans of sauce.  I am not a huge sausage fan so I usually omit the sausage and just use the 1 lb of beef.
