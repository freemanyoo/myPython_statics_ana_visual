I&#39;ve used it for over 20 years. It says it doesn&#39;t double well so I tripled it. It makes two large loaves after tripling. My question is can I substitute pumpkin purée for the bananas to make this into pumpkin bread with the appropriate spices? I know I could experiment but I&#39;d rather ask first. Thank you.

I live in FL and I have been collecting fresh mangoes every day on my way to work. I only had one ripe banana and a plethora of ripe ripe mangoes, so I did 114g of ripe banana puree and 114g of fresh mango puree. It turned out super tasty with gorgeous hues. I divided the batter into 4 mini loaves and baked for 40-45 minutes in my mini bread stone pan (until the toothpick came out clean). This way I was able to share the love a little further and pass out mini loaves to my co-workers, neighboors, and friends."

I divided my sugar.  1 cup white 1/2 cup brown sugar.  2.  I also used milk with a tablespoon lemon juice to substitute for the buttermilk that I didn&#39;t have.  3.  I also lowered my temp to 325.  I was using a cast iron bread pan.  It cooks hotter.  4.  I only cooked it for 1 hr. then let it cool for the 15 minutes.  Loved the parchment paper.  It definitely made clean up easier.

My family and neighbors like it.  At 350 it always burns the bottom and the ends. Today I was determined to get a good one.  I started at 350 but after reading some reviews lowered the temperature to 325. That made a nice banana bread not burnt.  The bread bakes dark.  Also I baked it for 1 hr 10 min. Given how many people have the burnt ends I think Taste of Home should make a correction or a comment.

I made a few adjustments, based on other reviews, and can’t believe that everyone in my family likes it! Even my daughter who said, “Eww, banana bread??” Lol! She loved it!My adjustments:I substituted 1/4 of the white sugar with brown sugar, used 2 1/2 bananas and reduced oil to 1/4 cup, used 1 tsp vanilla paste for the vanilla, added 1 tsp cinnamon and a tiny pinch of ginger and nutmeg. It does take quite awhile to bake, but be patient. It’s totally worth it!!!"

In addition, because of the extra banana, I was able to cut the eggs down to one but I did use  a large egg.I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, as my family likes that, but they aren&#39;t necessary as I tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet.

Takes a long, long time to cook; more than the usual banana bread recipe. The crust on the outside of the bread turned out a little thick, though I did not burn it. Will most likely make again and experiment with the baking temperature."

My husband has hated every recipe I have made and only likes his grandmas. I got his grandmas recipe and made it. And guess what? Did it turn out like grandmas? No. I tried this recipe last night. I used 3/4 of the all mixed, finished batter and put hat into a  loaf pan. The remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins. I did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs. This recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans. But my sister swore by this. No the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked. This was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan. I sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist. Most breads come out too dry when I use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time. My sister was right. Thanks sis! The bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this AMAZING recipe. I kept a eye on the bread after a half hour and did the tooth pick trick to see when my bread was done. Finally I have a banana bread recipe I will be excited to add to our family favs cook book!"

The baking time stated is a bit long for my oven, I would suggest testing before the stated baking time. Mine baked in an hour.  I always remove breads while still warm, not hot, allowing a bread to completely cool sometimes increases sticking.

BRILLIANT!! and though I&#39;m not used to the US Electric Fahrenheit 325&#39;F measure i just converted it to Centigrade 160-165&#39;C (in the UK I would use a Gas Oven GAS MARK 3) .  On with my version of the cake...  As one of my son prefers chocolate cake and hubby always likes nuts of some type in his cake, I too added cinnamon &amp; sliced my bananas to save extra washing up dishes but then added chocolate fondant, Walnuts and Cadbury&#39;s Drinking Chocolate (i reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup due to the sugar in the fondant (i had no chocolate in the cupboards) added a little milk (approx a quarter cup) and a drop more oil to keep the cake moist) it turned out fine, not quite as moist and squidgy as the usual banana chocolate cake you&#39;d expect but whoever tasted it say its perfectly fine.

The 1st time I tried the recipe I used an 11 cup pyrex dish as I saw that it made a really big loaf. I started to moniter the baking process at approx. 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick. This time I doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before, except I used only 3 bananas (only had that many) and baked in a 13 x 9. I also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting.

This was banana bread, not pudding, and I liked very much. Great flavor.  However, I did cut back on the sugar (only 3/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white) and substituted applesauce for oil. Didn&#39;t have buttermilk onhand so I just used milk and put some butter in for flavor. My dd and I are more than happy with the result.Raised up to a beautiful loaf of bread.  I don&#39;t know if it helped that I whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure I didn&#39;t have banana globs. I will continue to do that.Cons- considering how sweet it is, I would not follow the recipe sugar recommendation.Bake time for my loaf was too long, and I only had it in for 50 minutes. I was glad it was baked through, but if this had been for gifts, I would not have shared.  The ends will be way too tough and overdone. It is very tough about a half to an inch around.

I have made this 3 times and it takes about 60 mins at the most at 325 degrees.  Let the bread rest in the pan for 5-10 mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack.

I have another 8 bananas on the brink so I&#39;ll make a couple more double batches and work out my flaws.

For having only 1/2 cup of oil, in what turns out to be a very large loaf, I thought this was an exceptionally moist and flavorful bread.    I used 3 bananas instead of 2 since it was suggested by so many other reviewers.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly skipping only the nut since my family doesn&#39;t care for them.  Mine actually tested done after 1 hr and 10 mins.   The outer crust was slightly crunchy but not hard.    Will definitely keep this recipe and make it again."
