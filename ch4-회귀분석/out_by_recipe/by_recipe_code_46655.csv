I make 1/3 of the butter frosting recipe for the single layer, but keep the ganache the same.  I top with a variety of fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blue berries &amp; kiwi.

They were perfect!! It made exactly 24 cupcakes that I baked at the same temp as the recipe and 18 minutes of baking was just right. I had so many people tell me that it was the best cupcake they ever had! I took me all day to make them since I have little ones at home but it was so worth it! If you try this recipe you will not be disappointed. I can&#39;t wait to make them for Christmas Eve.

Or is the thickness normal?? Didn&#39;t see anyone else comment about it so...???"

I made it for a family gathering over Christmas and everyone loved it.  I&#39;m making it tonight for a co-worker&#39;s birthday tomorrow. One little tip - wrap your cakes in saran wrap, then reynolds wrap and freeze until firm.  This really helps in making the cake easy to trip and frost.  Such a beautiful and scrumptious case! I don&#39;t mind the time involved whatsoever."

I agree this is labor-intensive, especially because I doubled it the first time I made it and was worried to &#39;try it out&#39; Christmas day.  I used 2 cake mixes in 9x13 in pans- was afraid it wouldn&#39;t be enough for  everyone.  I had to increase the baking time, of course. Kept checking for doneness- ended up 40+ minutes at same temp. Didn&#39;t  need 2x frosting and really not 2x ganache - but I used all of it! I cut the strawberries in half to cover larger cake surface. I used choc chips for the semi-sweet chocolate and melted in microwave-that worked great. Next time I will use a plastic bag with hole snipped in corner to &#34;pipe&#34; the decorative designs.  Never got runny enough to drizzle from a spoon and was a mess to get out of my cake decorator once it hardened.  Transported the decorations in a shirt box wrapped in waxed paper and inserted just before we ate dessert.  Swore I would not make again if it was only as good as the box mix, but everyone raved. I guess it will become a tradition!"

The strawberries go bad before we can eat the cake, I would serve it with strawberries on the side next time.  I don&#39;t understand the others problems with the frosting, we loved it not to sweet and it wasn&#39;t too soft as others said.Being as it is December I had a hard time finding &#34;nice&#34; strawberries.

I had to agree.  In baking this cake I found that it took longer than the 28-32 minutes it called for to bake throughly.  The frosting was soft but easily spread without running and it was delicious.  I couldn&#39;t get the ganache to harden so I just dripped it over the strawberries and down the sides of the cake.  It was superb and the cake I thought was going to be dried out from extra baking time but it was beautifully moist.  A real surprise for excellency because it was formed from a cake mix.  I will definitely bake this again."
