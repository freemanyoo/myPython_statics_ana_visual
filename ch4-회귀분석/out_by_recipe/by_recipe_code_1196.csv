I also omitted using the 1/2 cup of water like the others did.  I appreciate their advice, because this was magnificent and no other changes are needed.

Used standard cane sugar and some maple syrup, and subbed all baking powder for the baking soda. Still turned out fantastic. One thing I love about this recipe is that it uses 1/2c water instead if just going for the 1 entire cup of canola oil, as less healthier recipes do. Would also try adding 1 or 2 teaspoons of vanilla next time. Forget canned pumpkin and used fresh if you can, it makes a world of difference!"
