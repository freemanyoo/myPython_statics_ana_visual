This has become my husband&#39;s favorite cool-weather soup.  I&#39;ve found that we always have leftovers with just the two of us and the tortellini tastes great in this soup, but it absorbs a large amount of the broth after the first day and kind of &#34;takes over&#34;.  I discovered that replacing the tortellini with fresh gnocchi is a fabulous substitution and the gnocchi is much better behaved in the leftover soup."

I did want to post this soup recipe because it is delicious ! When I make a recipe for the 1st time I usually follow it as I did this one, with the exception of I used all broth an no water, which was 3 cans. I could not find turkey links this time so I used Johnsonville Chicken Garlic links an just sliced them up an browned them with the onion. I thought this would taste bland without adding other seasonings but, I was wrong. It tasted great! Thank you Tracy for this gem!"

Soups are awesome) wife and both kids couldn&#39;t get enough( with the kids both 16 arguing about how to split the last bowls worth..    The changes and additions I made are for the proteins I used 4 boneless chicken thighs diced and browned in pot. 2 chicken sausage links with sun dried tomatoes browned in skillet then sliced.. For the water I used more chicken broth.. I also added 2 large carrots sliced and a mid to small zucchini halfed   length ways and sliced . I half the amount of garlic and added salted to taste (prob about 1/2 teaspoon) and I added the sausage at the same time as the tortellini

Great flavor and it took me 30 minutes to make and tasted like it simmered for three hours. I used only 1 cup of water (more chicken broth), used diced tomatoes with oregano and onion, and fat-free/reduced sodium chicken broth to reduce the calories further. I also had frozen tortellini so I used those as I think they hold up better than fresh."

I generally find adding garlic and other potentially harsher arromatics later so they don&#39;t burn is the right call. I then added a teaspoon of sweet paprika, a bay leaf, and two thyme sprigs right before the broth and tomatoes (replace water with all broth). Turned out fantastic. For the finer palate, a cup of gruyere added really is awesome in lieu of parmesan. Should note I doubled the recipe as well so all measures reflect that. Dankness."

It was delicious - very flavorful - and hearty. I used a total of two 32 oz Swanson chicken broth boxes because I thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing... I was glad I did. I did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth, which my bigger boxes of broth took care of. I skipped the can of diced tomatoes because I&#39;m not a fan but I can see how they would add to the soup for others. The recipe calls for turkey sausage but I used regular Italian sausage and it calls for 12 oz but I had 16 oz so I used the whole thing. For the  refrigerated tortellini, I used the tiny cheese raviolettis that Buitoni offers. I used fresh spinach from one of the 9 oz &#34;salad&#34; bags (probably used about 7 oz of it and didn&#39;t chop it up) and I did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because I love it. I used more than a dash of red pepper... did a couple of shakes. We did put shredded parmesan on top and I highly recommend. I served the soup with really good five grain bread and butter and, as I write this, I wish I was having the meal again tonight because it was AMAZING."

I sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting. I added the dried basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes when I added the broth and tomatoes (I did not add any water) so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out. (I used more seasoning than recipe called for and used 2 heaping tsps of dried basil, 1 tsp of black pepper, and added 3/4 tsp red pepper to suit our need for heat)I also added 3 tbs of chicken bouillon and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant.
