My family did enjoy the bread. It was the first recipe I tried out.  Someone else mentioned this comment and I fully agree after making a different recipe. The bread is actually too heavy.  Nice flavor but sits heavy and feels heavy. The biggest difference between this recipe and another I tried was how many eggs.  The other recipe I really liked took 3 eggs. I may have said I would make this again but not anymore.

To eliminate the bread not releasing from the pan do this:  Cut waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan after you spray the pan bottom to hold the wax paper tightly.

Do not spray the sides of the pan to allow the batter to rise and form a nice loaf.  I do this for all of my dessert breads.

I was out of milk so used 1/2 c nonfat plain Greek yogurt    1/2 t baking soda. Also I didn&#39;t use the lemon rind, but with the lemon glaze it was VERY (deliciously) lemony. I did heat the glaze until the sugar dissolved. Only baked it for 35 minutes (but split the recipe into 2 smaller pans).This was the best sweet bread I have ever tasted!

I&#39;d used the peel of 1 large lemon, 1-1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries with 1/8 cup all-purpose flour mixed in with the berries to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the loaves! I&#39;d used 1/4 cup lemon juice and1/4 cup sugar and I cooled the bread at least 20 minutes so that bread had a chance to settle!  I glazed the loaves as soon as they came out of oven.  I&#39;d probably bake the miniature  loaves 40 to 45 minutes and the 7&#34; loaves at least 45 to 50 minutes.

The solution is to reserve 1 Tablespoon of your flour and put in sandwich bag then add your completely dry blueberries and coat them.  This prevents them from falling to the bottom of your pan.This is a bread you could take anywhere and be proud.  Thank you to the person who took the time to post/share with me.
