It was excellent!  

The recipe was a bit high in sodium so I chose to use unsalted butter.  I added mushrooms (as my preferred cheeseburger is a mushroom cheeseburger) and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick.

A shoutout to the wife of James569 with the suggestion of a adding a bit of mustard to the bowl (just a skosh) and to cincibetty for suggesting doubling the hamburger.

This recipe is destined for my next potluck."

I saved myself a pan though in the directions - after I transferred the cooked ground beef (I used a full pound and it was perfect) to a plate, I melted all of the butter called for in the same pan, sauteed the onions, carrots and celery and then sprinkled the flour over top after the veggies had softened.  I mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth.  It smelled so good while it was cooking!!  Once the potatoes were cooked through, I added in the milk and I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta, it is what I had on hand.  I also left out the basil and the sour cream and I am glad I did - my whole family loved this and I will definitely be making it again!

I usually make it a few times a month in the fall and winter as it is one of the few meals that everyone in my family will eat.  I’ve adapted it a little to suit my family’s tastes.  I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddars instead of Velveeta, and I use a combination of peeled russet (all purpose) potatoes and unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes as I like the different textures.  Sour cream is not something that I keep on hand, so I rarely add it in.  We drink fat free milk, so I often use that instead of buying whole milk  just for using in this recipe.   To change things up from time to time, in place of ground beef, I’ve used both ground and link sausages (sliced thin) and cubed ham.  I’ve also left the meat out altogether and doubled the potatoes.  When using ground meat, I typically use a whole pound instead of a half pound.  Any way I make it, we like to sprinkle some bacon on top!  Enjoy!"

The mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup, but I did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product.  Solution, I pureed them once fully cooked with 1 cup of beef broth.  That is a second change I made, beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons.  For me, a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato, so that brought me to my third modification - 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices.  My fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef.  I also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup.  To keep the cooked ground beef moist &amp; tender, I did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done.  The mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup.  I used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted.  Rather than Velveeta, which contributes too much salt to the soup, I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 12 ounces of sharp cheddar (use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger).  The cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce, and made the sour cream unnecessary.  I finished with salt &amp; pepper to taste  along with a generous 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard.  After all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup (the tomatoes) and mustard?  While I made a number of changes that I prefer to this soup, I would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration."

He went back for seconds and ask on Sun. if there was any left that he could have for supper on Mon. night.  I didn&#39;t have basil or parsley so left out.  Used 8 oz. shredded Mexican chees and 8 oz. shredded co jack instead of Velveeta.  will be making this a lot this winter.    I used a full pound of hamb.  On Mon. I added a pint of home canned potato soup mix, a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls.  Potato soup mix is:  in a pint jar put  1/2 pint jar chopped potatoes, 1/4 pint sliced carrots, split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and fill with water.  Pressure can at 10 pounds for 20 minutes.  This makes a pretty jar for a gift also.  Put the instructions on it.To use heat soup mix with 1 Tablespoon butter or marg. and add one pint milk, check the salt and add pepper if you like.  Heat but don&#39;t boil.  If you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt. jar with 1 teaspoon of salt and pressure at 10 lbs. for 25 minutes.  You can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time.  These are handy to fry or add to soup."

However, I have no doubt that had I used the flour and butter roux it would have made the soup even richer and tastier. I was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didn&#39;t use broccoli since one of my family members doesn&#39;t like it.  I did double the recipe and it was very good! That being said here&#39;s what I did: I put the onion, celery and carrots and 1 cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for 10 minutes.  I then added the potatoes, the rest of the broth, the basil and parsley and simmered for another 10 minutes, until the potatoes were done.  To thicken the soup, I then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the broth/veggies mix, stirring constantly.   I heated the milk and Velveeta in the microwave, stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted.  I added the cheese/milk mix after the potatoes were cooked.  I did not add any salt and I did not use the sour cream.  I ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and I served it in homemade bread bowls.   Very, very good!"

I used 1 cup shredded cheddar instead of Velvetta. I just added it to the butter/ flour mixture and added the milk too. Then later I added another cup of cheddar cheese. Soup was not too salty, I actually had to add more salt than what the recipe called for. Also, I would definitely not add the sour cream at all. I tried the soup before adding sour cream and it was much better than after."

My husband isn&#39;t a huge soup fan and he went for seconds.  I did change it up a bit because I won&#39;t use processed cheese.  I made the rue in a saucepan instead of small skillet and then added the milk to it.  I then added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the milk mixture and whisked it in so there where no lumps.  Then I added that to the beef and potato mixture in the 3qt saucepan.  I mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added 2 tbsp. of Dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel.  I also used reduced sodium broth and didn&#39;t add the added salt at the end of the recipe in order to keep sodium to a minimum.
