It’s not overly sweet, like a pecan pie sometimes is. I used Hershey’s caramel topping. It wasn’t fat free. Otherwise, followed directions with the exception of time.   I read another review that said to bake longer and I did, about 8-10 minutes. It was awesome!  It’s neat how the syrup moves to the bottom under the cheesecake. I love that magic!  Anyway, super easy with limited ingredients and great taste.... just add a little more time.  Like the other review said, jiggly on top in the middle should be fine!"

I will definitely be making this one again. I put it in a graham cracker crust, and it was off the wall. I do, however have a couple tips to the people who claim the pie was too runny or eggy. When mixing the cheese filling, make sure you beat it smooth as the instructions say. It may take quite a bit of doing, considering you are dealing with cream cheese, especially if it isnt softened completely. Make sure there are no chunks left and that it is nice and whipped. The same goes for the caramel topping. I also only used 2 and a half eggs instead of 3 in the topping mixture. let the pecans swim, but dont drown them. I didnt completely use the entire topping mixture on mine. Finally, make sure your cheesecake is completely baked to the middle, and make sure you cool and refridge the pie for the proper amount of time."

The only change I made was that I substituted homemade brown sugar caramel for the store bought topping. Its the &#34;easy caramel sauce&#34; on the Pioneer Woman site, and it literally only takes five minutes to make.  Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before letting it touch the eggs, and keep it a little on the runny side - it will thicken a bit as it comes to room temperature, and you don&#39;t want it too thick when you mix it with the eggs.  The pie was great - a perfect blend of several wonderful tastes and textures.  I give it five stars."

Made it for friends and they loved it! I didn&#39;t use a deep dish pie crust, I used a graham cracker pie crust because its my fav with cheesecake, and pecan pie. Because I didn&#39;t use a deep dish pie crust I used less caramel than the recipe called for, maybe 2/3 of it was used. My pie still came out like the pic and maybe even better! The one problem I did have with the recipe is the timing to leave the pie in the oven. The recipe stated 35mins.

I wasn&#39;t sure what you meant by topping either, sounds like a cheaper brand of topping and not syrup will have the caramel sink to the bottom.  I kind of have  an issue with TOH in general, in that this takes way more than 30 minutes to make.  In general, your recipes, all the ingredients are prepared - pecans chopped, cream cheese softened and then you start the timer, I wish you would put your times in as if starting from scratch.

I had enough filling left over to make another pie.  I used Smuckers Caramel flavored Sundae Syrup which is used for ice cream. It was very thin. Is this the wrong kind of topping?  What kind should I use? I think my pie is going to come out soupy also like the other reviewer&#39;s did.  Thank for your help. Dragonlady.
