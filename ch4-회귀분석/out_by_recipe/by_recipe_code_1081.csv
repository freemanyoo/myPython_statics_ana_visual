I had fresh mushrooms that needed to be used so I chopped them up and put them in the onion and pepper saute.  My family really likes cheese so I doubled the amount of Parmesan on the top.

It&#39;s a time consuming recipe, but it&#39;s just okay tasting and not worth the effort as is. I added 5 garlic cloves and some salt and pepper to the hamburger while cooking it, but that extra seasoning didn&#39;t go far enough to make this have real flavor. If you like plain food, then you&#39;d like this. But if I were to make it again, I would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure. The casserole doesn&#39;t really have any sauce to it, and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole, leaving you with 2 layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato. There are other spaghetti casserole recipes I would try here before this one. It&#39;s really not that good."

After step 1 I add one can of beef broth with the diced tomatoes (I have used stewed also but I use my one hand blender to break up the tomatoes so they are not so chunky), no need to add water, when it comes to a boil I add uncooked bow tie pasta right into the pan (about  1 1/2 C. or so and cook for 10 min until pasta is done, then add 1/4 C grated cheese.  No need to bake.  I don&#39;t use cream soup or olives but every one I have made this for loves it."

My only change I made was to leave out the olives because we aren&#39;t fans of them.  Next time, to appeal more to the kids I will likely used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because they turned their noses up at the &#34;tomato chunks&#34;, and be sure to dice up the peppers smaller than I did.</p>"
