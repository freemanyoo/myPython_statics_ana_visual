I used corn and flour shells. The corn shells seemed much spicier but still good. I served these with cilantro lime rice however plain rice was preferred by others. I even subribed to Taste of Home after making this hoping for more success recipes!

Definitly different than what my mom made growing up (chicana) but SOOO GOOD. I rated 4 because using flour tortillas just isn&#39;t a good idea if you want nice crispy enchiladas, I would consider using flour tortillas more of a wet burrito type dish. They get soggy. I used corn tortillas instead (and a bit of advice that makes a world of difference is lightly frying your corn tortillas in oil on each side before placing filling in and rolling, makes them more durable and much more crispy to hold up against the sauce) and for the sauce (if you like it a bit spicy, even if not they have regular sauce) I recommend &#34;El Pato&#34; you can usally find in the mexican section of any store. I use the yellow or green cans both delcious. Also, I chopped up white onion and put on top of the enchiladas before spreading cheese. I also baked uncovered for an extra 5-10 mins to get the edges extra crispy ( mi familia loves it this way!) . Served with a simple red rice my mom used to make and it was delicious! Also, I did use cubed chicken because I used some left over breasts from the night prior but I will definitly be shredding it next time, my family didn&#39;t really dig that. All in all I love the filling recipe, very very good. Will be keeping this one! Thank you :)"

I made it exactly as described with one small addition. I made a microwave pouch of Mexican rice and before I put the stuffing in each tortilla I put a little bit of the rice. We topped them with pico de gallo and sour cream. I usually dread eating leftovers but I have looked forward to these and this recipe makes a lot. I actually ended up filling a 9x13 dish plus another 8x8 dish. Thanks for the great recipe!

Since returning three years ago this dish is easily the best we&#39;ve found -- and made -- yet!  Thanks so much for the recipe, Kristi.  My only addition to this was pickled red onions and Lime Crema Sauce (8 oz. sour cream, juice of 1/2 lime and 1/2 tsp. kosher salt) as garnishes.  We&#39;ve both decided it&#39;s a keeper and definitely worth making again and again -- even for company.  P.S. We found that we could only use 1/4 cup filling per tortilla thus easily make almost twice as many enchiladas as stated.  Each one was still very filling though.  Thanks again!"

Although I liked the flavor, in the first batch the filling was too &#39;soupy&#39; for my taste. Also, the flour tortillas became soggy. In the second batch I eliminated the salsa, and used just enough hot sauce to flavor and moisten. I also used corn tortillas, which is what I am used to with enchiladas. I used about half of the can of chilies.I always put a small amount of cream cheese in my enchiladas, - it adds a nice richness, and many people don&#39;t even realize it is there, although they are aware of the richer flavor. A small amount of cream cheese also enhances sandwiches, even if they have another type of cheese already!"
