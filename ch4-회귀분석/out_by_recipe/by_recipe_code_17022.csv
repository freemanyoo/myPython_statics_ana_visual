I didn’t have a tomato so I used a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted, chopped tomatoes (slightly drained… the rest of the liquid cooked out). This is a keeper and will be made again!!!"

This is indeed vegetarian even with the cheese. That other person doesn’t realize that vegan recipes have no cheese, but vegetarian recipes allow for cheese, eggs, etc. Tasted great! A keeper! Thank you!!!"

I was not sure if my husband would like this since there was no meat in it.  But he really liked it , the mushrooms take place of meat.  It also helped having used my homemade pasta!

I picked this recipe because we needed a meatless dinner to shake things up.  It also looked to be rather easy and quick to make which I knew would be appreciated by whoever ended up in the kitchen making it while I was volunteering.  I was so hungry when I got home and ready for a bite only to find it was gone.  Based on the fact that they couldn&#39;t control themselves to leave enough for 2 of us coming up late, I trust it was good!"

It wasn&#39;t bad but seemed to lack something, rather bland. For us this is not a keeper.  I didn&#39;t like the clumping of the shredded provolone cheese."

The only problem I had was the cheese melting and clumping together when I mixed it into the vegies and linguine.  The next time I make it I will add the basil to the vegies and linguine mixture and toss. Then only sprinkle the cheeses on top to serve.  Thanks for a great tasting recipe.
