I love the sage in it. I feel it sets it apart. If you are worried about the salt use a salt free broth- Walmart sells one.  I alternate corn and flour tortillas - every other one. I feel if they are all corn they are too mushy and all flour to gummy. Every other is just right. This is hands down a recipe that people ask me for over and over again.

We love enchiladas and this is one of my favorite recipes so far. The sauce was smooth and creamy but I did add a little more of the seasonings. I also added a chopped chipotle pepper to the sauce and a tablespoon of adobo sauce to the meat mixture because we like spicy foods. Overall an excellent recipe! I&#39;ll definitely be making it again.

We are garlic lovers, so this recipe stood out to me. Everyone ate it, although nobody was rushing to get a second helping. I thought the sauce was tasty and the dish overall was a solid recipe.

I agree that adding rice or beans to the meat would be a good option.  I used half the amount of salt and the minimum amount of chili powder as per other&#39;s ratings. Depends on how hot you want it.  Some said it was mushy so I didn&#39;t cook it as long.

I added some leftover rice I found in the fridge as a filler and it was nice. Next time I&#39;d add corn and black beans to the filling. A few notes- I wasn&#39;t too crazy about the sauce, found it to be quite bland and needing to triple the seasoning. It was also way too thick and clumpy. I ended up adding water to thin it out. I also added a bit of brown sugar to cut the salt and acidity. Next time I would half the amount of salt. On its own it was WAY too salty. Thankfully the toppings masked the saltiness. This also makes a huge batch of sauce. I have enough to last me 3 more occasions."

But my husband and I really did like this a lot. My teenage boys thought it was fine but they don&#39;t like Mexican food that much. I used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section. Traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has WAY too much salt. I also didn&#39;t add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested. The salt flavor was perfect. My husband also bought the HUGE tortillas so I still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla. I used 7 tortillas but they I cut about 1/3 off of them. I put in a little over 1/2 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top. We loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top. I wish I put avocado on top too. The flavor was great. There was a ton of sauce and we love sauce. Great meal.

I triple the recipe and use ground round or ground chuck instead of hamburger. I freeze 1 1/2 - 2 cups of sauce in a freezer bag and 2 1/2 cups meat in another freezer bag. Tripling the recipe makes enough for 4 - 5 meals. I use this recipe when a friend or family member is sick and needs a meal. Everyone asks for the recipe. The only change I’ve a made is an omission: I don’t add salt because there’s already salt in the broth and tomatoes. I also lean towards the lesser amount of chili powder because I have two daughters who don’t like spicy food. I love this recipe because it doesn’t have any beans, making it very kid-friendly!"

It is fusion cooking. This is Tex-Mex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional Mexican food made to please those North of the border.  Here, in Texas, people put beef in just about everything.  We always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladas.Traditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author noted.The sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products.  I can tell you with authority that most restaurants and Mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce.   California, Northern and Central Mexico don&#39;t use tomatoes in this way traditionally.As we live in Texas, I encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional Mexican food.  Some are o.k. but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation.   The same is true with many Mexican families here.For my enchilada sauce I only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent, then I add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least 4 minutes.   I then add the broth (Better Than Bouillon Chicken) and simmer for 30 minutes.  I don&#39;t add salt as there is enough in the broth.  My spice mixture is secret and handed down so I will not offer it here."

Over the years I&#39;ve tweaked a bit, for example, we love garlic so I use fresh garlic in the sauce as well as the meat mixture.  I use Rotel milder tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes. Sometimes I add rice to the meat...I&#39;ve even added sweet corn &amp; black beans a few times.  I left out the sage for years, just because I never cooked with it.  But I started to add it about 5 years ago &amp; it does make a difference.  All around a great recipe that&#39;s easy to modify for your own personal tastes."

The extra  1/2 tsp of salt is not needed its already salty from the beef broth.  Also I would use corn tortillas, like the texture better, not so soft like the flour.

Was good, but think I&#39;ll keep looking for a more authentic Mexican recipe. And was not bland at all!!  I dont know where some of these ppl&#39;s taste buds are!"

Everyone- even my picky eater- loved it. My only complaint is that it was way too salty and I did not even add all the salt called for and I also used low sodium beef broth. So my suggestion is to completely omit the salt. I also think this would be great with shredded chicken or beef, and with other things added to the filling like rice, beans or pickled jalapenos. I had enough filling for 13 of the 6 inch tacos. I bet you could also use corn tortillas instead of flour if you wish. Over all this was amazing and I will definitely make it again!

I used corn tortillas for myself to make it gluten-free.  I found I had to dip/brush sauce on both sides to keep them from breaking.  I left out the flour in the filling and used 1/4 cup cornstarch in place of the flour in the sauce to make it GF.  I just added the cornstarch to the broth.  I think this would taste good with beans, either in the filling or on the side.  Next time I might try reducing the butter.  Has anyone tried that?"
