I just use chicken, and chicken broth, salt, pepper, butter. For dumplings I use self-rising flour, small amount of shortening (about the size of a small egg) and water. mix this up till stiff.  Cut in strips or pinch off,) I pinch mine, then Add to boiling broth.  You can continue to add them even when they cover the top. Just take a spoon and put them down, keep adding as long as you can or want to. you will have to make more than one batch of dough.  I usually make 3 batches and use a 6Qt pot. But be careful, they will boil over.  When you are done adding dough, turn heat down, and continue to cook until they are shiny.  Then they are done.  If you want them like a biscuit inside, make bigger pieces to drop in. When you get enough dough, it will thicken itself. I you get it to thick, and more broth, or water.  Serve with Cornbread"

Certainly not from the mountains and if it did I would have eaten at your house 1 time and that would have weaned me. Ain’t even close to what a dumpling should be. Balls of dough that you called a dumpling ( ugh).for one thing milk does not go in dumplings at all. A good strong broth is the flavoring of a dumpling   salt and pepper. A cup or two of cool broth to mix with your flour. Rolled out thin on a floured surface and left for an hour or so. Cut with a pizza cutter in 1”x2” pieces and drop into boiling broth and stir gently continuously to keep from sticking. Salt and pepper to taste and you can thicken with a mixture of plain flour and cold water . Add while it’s at a gentle boil while stirring. Turn down to simmer. It’s very easy to over boil and dumplings will fall apart. Do not put a lid on the dumplings. You can add shredded or cut up chicken if you wish.
