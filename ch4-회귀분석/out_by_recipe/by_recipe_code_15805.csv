I did add some balsamic vinegar to the bruschetta on the suggestions of several reviewers, making it more like authentic bruschetta.  The only other thing I did differently was to use the bread crumbs to coat the chicken (after the egg dip) rather than to just place it  on top of the chicken.  I halved the recipe since there was only two of us, but I did make the whole recipe of the bruschetta.  I tossed the extra onto some angel hair pasta and it made a nice side for the chicken.  Will definitely make again."

It looked nothing like the photo which should have been my first clue when I saw what looked like an omelet under  the chicken.  Usually you do egg then flour so I dont know if this was the problem or if it was suppose to be like this.  Too much basil and garlic for 1/4 c of bread crumbs. Wont be trying this one anymore.

The combination of basil, tomato, garlic and cheese is one of our favorites and we adored it on the chicken. We lightened it up by using grilled chicken instead of the breaded.

Well, It was just wonderful.  I served it with smashed potatoes, string beans &amp; a salad.  Everyone expressed how delicious it was.  Thank you Taste of Home for a great low cost company dinner.  Keep them coming.Retired Nana"

Are you using butter with your crumbs-most margarines today contain water which could be causing the soggy problem. Also, you are leaving the foil loose, right so that cooking is aided, but steam escapes? I&#39;m going to try dipping the breast halves in skim milk and then in panko crumbs to see how that turns out. (Panko crumbs are coarser, crisper bread crumbs that allow you to bake things with a crispy coating without frying. It is a newer product here in the US)"
