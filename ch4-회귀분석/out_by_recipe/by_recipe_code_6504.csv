Recently my wife is on a special diet and has lost a lot of weight. Because of this diet, she cannot use crackers or breadcrumbs. Her weight loss coach told her to use pork rinds/Chicharones as a binder. I used that and it did not affect the taste at all. She also cannot use the topping, so she has special ketchup that her coach told her to use."

The one thing I would change is the amount of brown sugar. I have a real sweet tooth, but this seemed like a bit too much sugar to me (especially for an entree). Next time, I will likely reduce the amount of brown sugar by half. But overall - a very good meal loaf! </p>"

I have never had very good luck making meatloaf.  It was either way too dense or it would fall apart.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I did, however, add/change a couple of things.
A while back I ordered &#34;tomato powder&#34; from the Spice House.  I always forget that I have it.  But I saw it in the refrigerator (keeps it from getting hard as a rock), and figured I&#39;d add it in to the ground beef.  I used about a tablespoon.  I suppose you could always use a couple of tablespoons of the double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube.

I also used mostly 90/10 ground beef, but figured I&#39;d add some 80/20 in for some extra moisture (and obviously more fat).   My mom always used Ritz crackers for meatloaf or meatballs....so I combined Ritz crackers and saltines...not really sure it made a difference.  Then I added about one or two teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet to the mixture.

I&#39;m not sure if my changes made any difference at all from the original recipe, but this was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  My 29 year old son, asked me if it was any good, and I told him to taste it and let me know.  He called from the kitchen and said,   &#34;Dad, this is the BEST meatloaf!  What the world did you put in this?&#34;"

I make a couple of changes, though. I use 2 pounds of ground beef (or meatloaf mix; that&#39;s good, too). Otherwise, it turns out too &#34;loose&#34; for our taste. I grate the onion instead of chopping it. That way, its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf. And finally, instead of one free-form loaf in the middle of my 13&#34; x 9&#34; pyrex pan, I make two. That way, there&#39;s more surface to be covered with the sauce, and we just like it better that way. Leftovers make awesome sandwiches, too!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Michelle Beran!"

Next time though I&#39;ll follow the advice of a previous review and add the Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and skip the sauce.  My family only likes a little sauce on top and this recipe made way more than we needed.  Instead I&#39;ll just add a little ketchup to the top before cooking.  I used 2.25 pounds of ground beef instead of 1.5 pounds because that&#39;s how it was packaged and I didn&#39;t have a need to save a small amount.  It still turned out fantastic.  Much better than using the meatloaf seasoning packet like I&#39;ve always done before.

I must say I did make some changes, but my hubby has always liked my usual meatloaf, but he loves this one. I replaced the milk with a can of golden mushroom soup, packet of Lipton onion soup, deleted the sage, not big sage fans,  The amount of cracker crumbs had to increased.  I used almost a full sleeve of crackers and probably could have been ok with the whole sleeve. It is a winner in our book."

Instead of a runnier sauce you will have a tangier topping that is absorbed into the flavor of the meatloaf in the top layer.  Change the saltines to seasoned bread crumbs (Italian or Garlic seasoned), add chopped sundried tomatoes to bring hints of the tomato tang throughout the meatloaf and use chopped sweet Hawaiian onions for a flavor balance."

I did make the following adjustments: I used ITALIAN bread crumbs, 1 onion, chopped, 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and 1 cup of Barbecue sauce at that time since I didn&#39;t have the ingredients to make regular BBQ sauce!  I&#39;d used a meatloaf pan to bake this meatloaf!</p><p>I would  probably omit the brown sugar in this sauce if I choose to use prepared BBQ sauce and I&#39;d probably omit the Worcestershire sauce since BBQ sauce has all the additions in it already! As I recall, this meatloaf was really good!  Thank you for sharing it with Taste of Home!  delowenstein</p>"
