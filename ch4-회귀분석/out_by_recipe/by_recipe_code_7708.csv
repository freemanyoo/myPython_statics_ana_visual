They came out like out of the bakery and I am not a good baker (but am a good cook). Also spingle a little caster sugar on top before baking and you get a sparkly top.  I also used only on over ripe banana.

My bananas were very large so I used 2 1/2.  I added about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  I also topped some with raw sugar and the rest I sprinkled on large sugar crystals that i use to top cookies.  I liked the &#34;crunch&#34; that the sugar gave to the muffins.  Muffins do take the full baking time and then I baked a couple of minutes more.  I got 18 muffins from the recipe.

What I like most about this recipe is how easy it is to jazz up.  I add chopped walnuts, or chocolate chips to it, sometimes a dash of almond extract instead of vanilla.  This is my go-to recipe to use up ripened bananas. It&#39;s quick and my family scarfs them down in no time."

In the recipe I usually make, it has use a slightly different ratio of flour and sugar (2 c flour and 1/2 sugar) so it&#39;s the same volume of dry ingredients but the first time I made this recipe I followed it as written. I thought it would be too sweet with double sugar I&#39;m used to tasting and three sweet, ripe bananas but it wasn&#39;t too sweet at all. In fact, the person in my office who usually is most concerned with sugar content raved about these and with good reason too because they are delicious! If you want to reduce the sugar by up to half the called for amount, they are still yummy, but just remember to compensate by adding flour equal to the reduction in sugar. Personally, I&#39;m fine with 1 c sugar. The only variations I use are to sprinkle the top of each muffin with about 1/8th tsp of raw unwashed sugar before baking  because the big crystals bake a nice caramelized sugar crunch to the muffin tops. I also preheat the oven 100 degrees higher than baking temp then when I put the muffins in, drop the temp to the correct temp. I found these indeed take the full 18 min or so even with the high preheat temp. Supposedly, the high preheat temp makes them crown higher without over baking them. As a side note, parchment paper cupcake liners work the best if you have them. Thanks for reading my long review. Again, killer recipe! I&#39;ve made it several times now with great results each time. Thank you so much for a great addition to my muffin rotation!"

I sometimes add 1C of blueberries or 1C diced strawberries.  I always add about 1/2C chopped walnuts or pecans.  I make 18 instead of 12 muffins because of the additions and I found the original recipe to be just too much for only 12 muffins.  Everybody loves these muffins.  YEEEAAA!!!

My &#34;go to&#34; muffin recipe, especially when I have extra bananas around.  I have made this 1001 times. There are so many ways to tweak this, and the result is always perfect.  I always decrease the oil to 1/4 cup, then add a heaping tablespoon of either vanilla yogurt, sour cream or applesauce to compensate. I also always decrease the sugar by a few tablespoons and you would never know.  Sometimes I add some shredded zucchini, by decreasing an equal amount of banana.  My Mom&#39;s favorite way to enjoy these was warmed in the microwave with a dab of butter.  They are also good with chocolate chips mixed in, or by adding a streusel topping."
