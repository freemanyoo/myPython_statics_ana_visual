It wouldn&#39;t add to the labor and it makes the dish more flavorful. It&#39;s an easy recipe and next time I will try with refrigerated ravioli because that&#39;s what I have."

I was looking for a very easy recipe for the two of us to make and this worked well. She loves watching cooking shows on tv and decided we should add more sauce the next time. I think I would also add some garlic and add onions as I brown the beef.

I cut the original recipe in half and we ate half of that giving us another meal sometime in the future. There are just two of us so a little goes along way. Served it with some Italian baguette bread to mop up the bottom of our bowls."

I made it with ricotta and spinach ravioli and it reminded me of my favorite lasagna. This is a great sub-in when you&#39;re craving lasagna but don&#39;t want to spend the hours making one from scratch.

It was delicious the way it was, but I agree with other commenters that it could use extra sauce. Next time i will add an 8oz can of good quality pizza sauce as well. I will also substitute about a third of the mozzarella for fontina, and add parmesan to the top. And will add an Italian sausage or two to the ground beef.

Lots of ways to have fun with this easy recipe!

Thanks, this was a comfort food winner!"

I have jazzed it up a bit since I first tried it.  The first time I made it strictly by the book...,Ned while it was good, I felt like it was lacking something.  Taking my own cue for the traditional lasagna I typically make, the next time I made this I added some chopped onion and baby portabella mushrooms, and I used one package of ground beef plus I  added one pound of bulk Italian sausage.  Once thry were all cooked together, I  layered the ravioli  ( cheese only)  the sauce, the mozarela cheese, plus I also added a package of provolone cheese slices, divided, and I topped twitch one half a jar of Alfredo sauce.  I then repeated the ayers , endings with the red sauce and cheese, and baked as directed.  It&#39; is  a lot easier than putting the traditional lasagna recipe together.  I have served this to several friends, and they all love it!  Thanks for posting the original recipe, which has since morphed into my new favorite lasagna recipe!"

It&#39;s cheesy, indulgent, gooey, comfort food taken to the tenth power.I made two pans, one using Italian sausage (that I seasoned with onions and Italian spices) for a carnivore friend and a meatless version for myself. Both were wonderful and garnered big thumbs up!! Thanks to the other reviewers for suggesting sausage instead of beef, it really added richness to the dish.Other minor changes: I used two types of ravioli: cheese and portabella-cheese. I used one jar of marinara and one jar of vodka sauce and a shredded blend of mozzarella, parmesan, and romano.As far as steps, I followed them exactly, and it was easy as pie (and as tasty!). I couldn&#39;t believe how great both pans looked when I pulled them out of the oven, or how good the kitchen smelled. A keeper for sure!!"
