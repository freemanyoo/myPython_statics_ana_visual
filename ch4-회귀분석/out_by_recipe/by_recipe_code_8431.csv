I made these bars for friends for a Memorial Day cookout and they were a hit. The tart rhubarb and the sweet topping are a perfect match. I pulled them out of the oven and allowed to cool for about 1 hour before serving them warm with the creamy topping. My husband ate one cold for breakfast the next morning. I will freeze the rest for later.

I love strawberry rhubarb pie so I cut the rhubarb to 4 cups and added 2 cups of strawberries. I used fresh rhubarb and fresh strawberries. I think frozen would have added too much moisture. There is a lot of sugar but it was worth it. Next time I&#39;ll use whipped cream and lose the extra 1/2 cup of sugar.  Also, 36 bars from a 13x9 baking dish makes them more like cubes.

We had a house-full of people, so it makes enough. I will be bringing this to pot-lucks, for sure.  It certainly was NOT bland.  We used freshly picked rhubarb. We all loved the shortbread crust. I feel this was an easy recipe and quick, but then, I had my rhubarb already cut and didn&#39;t bake the crust before adding the filling. It tastes more custardy when eaten warm.

I received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe. Tell-tale vote was in the fact that I took home an empty pan! The bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting. I also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used. It gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would.
