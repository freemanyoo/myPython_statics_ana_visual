The sauce just wasn&#39;t there, or so thin it just fell through the noodles to the bottom of plate. The flavor was also just so so for me. Thinking maybe adding some cream and maybe a touch of dill, right before the the breadcrumbs and Cheese might have helped the flavor and thicken the sauce a bit."

I made it for dinner last night and the only adjustments I made were to add white wine to produce more sauce but it was still far too dry and to top the pasta with the shrimp mixture before broiling  We also thought it was very bland; with the amount of garlic and lemon juice we thought it would taste better.  I&#39;ve been thinking about how to improve it: add lemon zest?  saute the shrimp in the butter/oil instead of simmering in the liquid?  I&#39;ve decided to use other shrimp scampi recipes instead.  The crispy broiled topping was wonderful so will try that with another recipe."
