I did follow the recipe, however for my personal preference this soup needs more flavor. The beef flavor, and Velveeta are not enough to increase the saltiness  Perhaps just simply seasoning the ground beef while cooking will be enough. I am going to make this again and experiment."

One of my favorite gluten free substitutes for wheat flour in recipes is Bob&#39;s Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour.  It contains a blend of five different gluten free flours that makes an EXCELLENT substitute in all your recipes.   *Note:  you would use the cornstarch or the GF AP Flour in equal measures to replace the wheat flour."
