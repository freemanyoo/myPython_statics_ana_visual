It is skim milk and a lot of sugar. Heavy Cream or real full fat half and half are far better than the chemical  storm known as fat free half and half. It actually should not be legally called half and half its skim milk and sugar. Devoid of flavor and substance filled with nasty chemicals and sugar. Why do we have an obesity problem in this country because of misnomers like this.  dictionary says a wrong or inaccurate use of a name or term when speaking of fat free half and half.

I did make modifications when doubling.  Tripled the clam juice and omitted the water.  Then, used heavy cream instead of the ff half &amp; half.

I only had mini potatoes so I didn&#39;t peel, just cut them in quarters.  The skins remained on and added a color to the mix.

I turn mine into seafood chowder by adding 2 cans of escargot and tiger shrimp.  I also use my home made bone broths either chicken or turkey as I can control the sodium levels this way.  I  don&#39;t have to add any extra chicken bouillon.  If I need extra salt I add 1/4 tsp of celery salt.  I always have reserve bacon grease so if I don&#39;t have any bacon on hand it has the flavour in the soup already.  It is nice to change it up once in a while.  I also use this recipe for loaded baked potato soup because it so much easier.  Enjoy!

My family and guests thought it was great and finished every drop.

I didn&#39;t have clam juice but I had shrimp shells saved in the freezer so I boiled those for broth and used that in place of the clam juice and it worked good. I made a double batch. I also had less than half the onion called for, but I had green onions growing in my garden and used about a cup of those in place of one of the onions. I ended up adding 1 extra can of clams.. first reason was because I bought a pallet of them on clearance. Yeah. I thought it was a good move. And I wanted the extra clams because I was short on that clam juice. -- Also, I&#39;m going to try it again lower carb by only using 1 small potatoes and then chopped cauliflower and I might try cream cheese in place of the flour.

I did however make a few changes do to my liking of clam chowders i&#39;ve had in the past. i added a small carrot finely diced. Instead of 1 cup water i added another bottle of clam juice since i was using fresh clams there was no juice. I also cut the bouillon down since i was using the extra juice. i also used heavy cream instead of half and half so i didn&#39;t need the flour. Sprinkled black pepper on top after it was cooked..It was a hearty thick creamy soup and i will definitely make it again. This is the second time i&#39;ve made it so i knew it needed some tweaking. I also let me veggies and clams cook longer before adding the potatoes and broth. Served with oyster crackers,,It was so yummy!"

Even my husband loved it, and he&#39;s not all that nuts about creamed soups.  The only things I did differently was double the white pepper andstir the crumbled bacon right into the soup.  This is definitely a recipe I&#39;ll use over and over again.  Thanks!!"

I made this last night and even my daughter who will NOT eat soup loved it!  I just ate some of the leftovers for lunch and it was even better than I had remembered.  It was so full of flavor and I felt like it was from a high quality restaurant!  You won&#39;t be disappointed!

I thought it was a bit too peppery, but that is easy to remedy.  Loved how creamy it is.  Will definately make this again."
