Made few changes 1. Substitute brown sugar with Jaggery 2. Could not get oats so substituted with crushed oats cookies. 3. Instead of water and sugar used canned apple juice. The recipe came out perfect. SO easy and so delicious!! </p>

There&#39;s no need to make an apple pie with crust after making this gem.  It is extremely simple and the taste is phenomenal.  If you love apple pie a la mode, this is the recipe for you!  I get requests for it over and over again.  The only change I make is adding an extra apple or so until the apples are piled high in the pan.  I also split the apple varieties and use honeycrisp and granny smith.  I use a little more granny smith than honeycrisp.  Usually about (3-4) honey crisps to (4-5) granny smiths - dependent on apple size."

There was a nice balance of oats to sugar and butter and flour. The apple mixture was horribly sweet. I love sweet, but after a few bites, I had enough. My son and husband who usually pick away at the rest of the pan finished theirs, but that was it. I was ready to throw the rest away when I decided to use it as a topping for steel cut oats this morning. With a ratio of two parts oat to apple topping it was perfect with unsweetened coffee. Next time I would cut the sugar in half.  It is also a nice mix-in with Greek yogurt but as a dessert a big disappointment for such great reviews."

We acquired some apples from my son&#39;s tree which we believe to be a golden delicious.

Of course I had to eat my first serving before it had cooled completely with melting vanilla ice cream on top. So delish, and I know it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors blend together. I will make it with granny smith apples and try apple cider instead of water next time and I believe it&#39;ll be perfect for my family&#39;s taste. Thanks so much for sharing Gertrude!"
