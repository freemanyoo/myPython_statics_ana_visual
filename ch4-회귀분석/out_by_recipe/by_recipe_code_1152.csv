I absolutely hate when I read reviews and they say all the stuff they add that’s not  in the recipe!  With that being said I absolutely loved this recipe - I did double the sauce but made it exactly like the recipe and I put the pork chops on the bottom and then added the potatoes!  You could cut the pork chops with a fork it was amazing!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

I found the potatoes bland and needed something.   The chops were overcooked but I did use loin chops.   Still an hour and a half I think would dry out most chops.   I wouldn&#39; t follow this recipe again without some serious changes.

Great flavour and presentation. The pork was of course overdone so I think next time I&#39;d be tempted to just brown one side or perhaps put them in raw and just broil for a couple of minutes at the end. I cut back a little on the broth and added a dollop of cream just to spoil myself.

I baked the potatoes and gravy first for half hour. And I put onion powder in the gravy. I also marinated the pork with cajun seasoning and olive oil for a few hours before hand. Then I coated the pork with corn starch to hold the moisture inside. Pan fried it with a little olive oil enough to sear it. Then add to the potatoes. And I keep it closed the whole time.

I made it per the recipe, except for the addition of poultry seasoning sprinkled on the chops (I like this on chops) and the potatoes (I thought they could probably use more than just salt and pepper).  I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and onions very thin. The potatoes were delicious, but after 25 minutes the 1/2 inch thick pork chops were dry and way overdone.  I could not see baking this for the recommended hour and a half since the chops are browned, which par-cooks them. I would recommend checking for doneness early.  I did have my doubts about &#34;scalloped&#34; potatoes with chicken broth, but they were so good I would make them on their own next time."

I use pork steaks instead of pork chops and I cook them for about 3 hours at 300 degrees.  the pork chops come out fall apart tender and the potatoes are nice and yummy.  Two pork steaks and potatoes give my wife and i enough for two meals.  But these are really good.  Brown your pork in a cast iron skillet that is really hot so you get the nice sear.  I have also browned them on the grill and then put them in the oven which is really good as well.

I would think this would overcook the chops.  Chops are best at 145° f,  which is USDA safe for today&#39;s pork.  I have found browning is often sufficient to nearly reach this temp.  Cooking according to this recipe is a throwback to when a pork chop had to be cooked until it was dry. Cooking above 145°f squeezes the internal fat and juice out of the meat fibers as they contract. The hotter the meat, the more squeezing.  Pork today is much leaner than years ago when it had to be cooked much higher to be safe to eat (to avoid Trichinosis).  I suggest baking the potatoes and sauce first then add the browned meat maybe the last 15 minutes depending on the internal temperature of the browned chops.  Ideally, pull when the meat reaches 145°f."

Just finished cleaning up after making these for dinner tonight.  Everyone loved them!  I liked the fact that the pork chops stayed moist, but crispy at the same time; Baking them with the potatoes make it simple.  I coated the pork chops in 1/2 C Flour   1 tsp Paprika   1/2 tsp Salt   1/2 tsp Pepper   1 tsp Oregano.  For the sauce, I chopped the onion and sauteed it in the butter, added 3 TBS of the seasoned flour mixture, and followed the rest of the recipe as written. I served this with a side of steamed carrots and buttermilk biscuits.  Yum!! Thank you so much for sharing. I will make this one of my regular recipes for Pork Chops."

You dredge the pork chops in seasoned flour, then saute them in oil in a skillet till browned.  Then remove the pork chops, add 1 tablespoon to the drippings in the pan, add more seasoning if needed, then add 1 cup milk.  Cook on medium heat until thick.  Slice potatoes and onions and layer in a baking dish.  Pour gravy over the potatoes and onions, then top with the pork chops.  Bake at 400 degrees, covered, for 45 minutes.  Remove cover and bake for another 15 minutes....delicious"

Sadly, I should have tried the recipe first as written but so many said that additional sauce was needed.  So rather than double the ingredients, I did a 1.5X the amounts and had enough sauce to sufficiently cover the potatoes.  After an hour, I removed the foil and there was so much sauce/juice that the dish was swimming in liquid.  I literally spooned out all of the extra sauce which easily made up the extra 1/2 that I added.  The potatoes were very tender (used a mandolin for thinner slices) and the sauce was a hit -- delicious.  Next time I would brown the chops and only add to the dish at the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I used 1 inch chops and they turned out dryer than I&#39;d like.

It took 1 hour and 15 mins to bake on 350 for an hour then 375 for 15 mins. The flavor was delicious og the gravy i added some garlic in it an my potatoes were perfect but my chops were dry tasting. My grandma used to bake her chops with potatoes and i was craving it but this is definently not my grandmas way of making it her chops were very juicy and delicious and the gravy was more liquid like but she is passed so the recipe is still a mystery ??but this helped curbed that craving. I do suggest not adding salt to this dish because the chicken broth already has alot of salt in it!"

Next I made the gravy scraping the bits from browning the pork chops.  Had read reviews and put the pork chops back in the gravy followed by the onions and potatoes.  Pulled the pork chops back to the top during the last 30 minutes.  Perfect!  Excellent meal and hardly any dishes.

I made this dish tonight and my entire family LOVED it (&amp; they can be very picky--3 teenagers)!!!  I had 2 packs of pork chops and followed this recipe for 1 pack and a different recipe for the other pack.  This one won - - hands down!  I used everything listed in the recipe, but used Lawry&#39;s Seasoning Salt with the pepper.  This is by far the best pork chop dish I have ever made.  Something to note:  After an hour, I took the cover (tin foil) off and checked the pork chops and potatoes.  They were done, therefore, my meal was done in 1 hour instead of 1 1/2 hours.  I&#39;m so glad I checked them so that they didn&#39;t end up dry.  This was an easy and delicious 5 star meal that I will be making often!  (*I did not need to double the sauce because this recipe made plenty of sauce.)"
