They didn&#39;t rise up much but thats ok, just eat another to make up for it.  I don&#39;t think I have ever baked a cake without vanilla extract and the batter recipe didn&#39;t call for it so I added some.  The added vanilla made the cupcakes almost too sweet, and I love sweet but next time I won&#39;t add any, there is already some vanilla in the frosting,  that is probably enough.  Also, this recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes plus a small bundt cake, you could easily get 3 dozen cupcakes from this recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again, it is a keeper!"

My friend wanted a good seasonal cupcake recipe after she volunteered to bake desserts for another friend&#39;s November baby shower. I volunteered to help, and after baking a test batch, we made just a couple of alterations. For the &#34;pumpkin spice&#34; we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg, about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove, and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoon.For my palate, I&#39;d add even more spice in the future, likely the nutmeg and clove, but generally the spice level seems good for most people. I decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup, and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future, along with adding about 1/4 cup more cream cheese. We also added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a vanilla bean (split the bean and scrape out), along with the cinnamon, which made it a really rich tasting frosting.If you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way, and  the cupcakes look professionally made, nice to take to parties and holiday events. To top them off we sprinkled finely chopped candied ginger on top of the finished frosting."

Thus, the cupcakes didn&#39;t set fast enough in the oven and had &#34;hat brims&#34; of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice dome.I also made half of the frosting (as suggested by previous reviewers) and it covered all 30 (not 24 as the recipe claims) cupcakes nicely. The frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for (what I think is) a lot of cinnamon.As to why frosting might not be setting up (as mentioned by Alie0717): If you make cream cheese frosting with low-fat (Neufchatel cheese) or fat-free cream cheese, it doesn&#39;t have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting. Soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only full-fat or regular cream cheese. Remember, the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting."

I think next time I&#39;ll add more cinnamon to the frosting. I also suggest that you keep the frosting @ room temprature until you&#39;re SURE you&#39;re finished with it as it&#39;s SUPER sticky and very hard to work with cold.
