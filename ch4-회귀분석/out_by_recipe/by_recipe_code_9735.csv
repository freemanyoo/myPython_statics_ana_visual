It turned out terrific and even my picky children liked the soup.  I will say that it needs to be cooked in a larger instant pot as it ran over in my 6 quart instant pot (14 minutes with instant release).  I put the sour cream in at the end before serving.  But I will make this again.

I also substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillon, added the carrot mixture when I added the chicken, and added some salt and pepper.

I used cream of celery soup ( because I like the layer of flavor it adds) I too added 1C diced celery and shredded carrots. I didn’t have sour cream ( who ate my sour cream?) but I did have 1/2 block cream cheese oh yeah you heard me right. It’ll be ready shortly. I’m drooling.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

I, too, added carrots ( 1 can, drained, cut up a little in the can before adding to soup) and finely diced onion and celery (cooked in broth until soft the night before while I was cutting up the chicken). I agree that maybe 4 cups of noodles would have been plenty. Gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because all those noodles soaked up all the broth while it was on low in the crock pot during the party ,even with my adding lots of extra broth! It was so good, I will make it again but with less noodles and not for a long-standing-time event."
