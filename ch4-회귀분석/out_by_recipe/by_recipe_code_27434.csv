Definitely use rice vinegar in place of white, as well as chili sauce in place of ketchup. The five spice is a must for fabulous flavor, (freeze spice for later repeat meals if nothing else). We do add a bit more red pepper for extra heat. Also, no need for the extra step of cornstarch slurry. Just mix that in with the rest of ingredients, and pour over chicken, and simmer 20 minutes. Oh, and double the sauce. So yummy over the rice."

However, you could easily swap out thighs for breasts if you aren&#39;t a dark meat eater. If you don&#39;t have Chinese 5 spice, a close substitute is Garam Masala. Use the same measurement."

I was skeptical with the orange juice because I have had bad experiences in the past but it was delicious!

The chicken thighs can be sous vide cooked for 1.5 hours at 165. They are then easily browned in a skillet, removed and the sauce added. Once the sauce comes to a boil, add the cornstarch/water mix and once the sauce thickens, put the chicken back in and serve. Cuts down on the final prep time. Love it!"

I did not have the 5-spice or the red pepper flakes but substituted some chili power and extra black pepper and it was still great.  We dont like really spicy foods so next time I may add 1/2 the red papper flakes or a dash of the 5-spice if I can find it to see if that changes anything.

Just a little twist from this recepi.Use lime juice (2tblspoon) instead of orange juice. Ommit tomato sauce.  Substitude with tamarind juice (2tblspoon) if you did not use lime juice at all. Before you fry the chicken with corn oil, oat it with 1teaspoon of tumeric powder 1teaspoon of salt. When chicken is done, scoop out the chicken. Use the same oil to cook the sauce. Remember to season the sauce with salt &amp; sugar (up to you). Put the chicken into the sauce and stir a while. The sauce should be sweet &amp; spicy. There are many version of Asian style. This is one of the simple ones. Hope you&#39;ll enjoy Asian food."

Stores I purchased from (eastern US) Harris Teeter, Whole Foods, Kroger, and oriental market stores.  Brands were McCormick (recent), W-F&#39;s 365, Badia &amp; Goya in the Hispanic section.

I allow that to cook on its own for a bit then add the chicken and let that finish cooking. Then serve.
