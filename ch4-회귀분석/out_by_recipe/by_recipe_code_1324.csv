First, I only use 1/4 c water in the meat mixture, and add an egg to help bind the ingredients when mixing - otherwise they tend to fall apart. I use a quick rice. Also, I microwave the onion in a tsp of water for 1.5 minutes before mixing in with rest of ingredients. Most importantly, I make 1.5 times the sauce by increasing all of the ingredients by 1.5 except the water, which I leave at 1c. (I use Italian seasoned tomato sauce.) This way we have plenty of sauce, as we like to enjoy this dish over mashed potatoes.  PS: Remember to cover the dish while cooking or your rice may not get done!

They are a family  favorite.  I use calrose rice as that is what we keep on hand for everything.   It is very simple and easy.    I generally don&#39;t use any additional ingredients and have never had a problem with the rice not cooking.   It is very soft but will hold together if carefully browned.  If that is too hard then baking the meatballs might be simple.  We love the moist tender texture.

For people complaining about the rice being to hard there is a trick my mom used and I do too.  Put the rice in a bowl and cover with the 1/2 cup water and let it sit for at least 10 mins(I usually get everything else ready and by that time the 10 mins is almost up).  That will soften the rice a little and make it cook better.  We use that trick for making Stuffed Peppers also.

I&#39;d been craving porcupine meatballs, a memory from childhood.  I also babysit my great-grandson once a week and wanted something for lunch that might appeal to a 2 1/2 year old.  I followed the instructions to the letter except for the celery salt.  I had some, but I couldn&#39;t remember how old it was so I omitted that ingredient.  The meatballs were perfect...the rice perfectly cooked and the sauce was thick and savory.  I only meant to sample them as they are to be our lunch tomorrow.  I put three on a saucer and ended up going back for three more.  (I&#39;m actually tempted to go back a 3rd time.)  I&#39;ve copied the recipe and added it to my notebook of favorites.  Someone suggested that the ones who complained of undercooked rice might have made the meatballs too big.  I simmered mine exactly an hour and the rice was just right."

I simply doubled the ingredients because I just couldn&#39;t see 1 pound of hamburger filling up three people. We used white instant rice for the recipe and it worked great in my opinion.Two adults and our 16 year old daughter. She ate five of the twenty meatballs that I was able to make for the 2 pounds of burger. I browned in olive oil on medium high heat and basically just browned both sides because the 12&#34; skillet was a little crowded. I removed the browned meatballs to a plate while I disposed of the grease from the pan. I also rinsed the pan with hot water once the grease was gone. I returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with the sauce (2x recipe for me).Simmered on a low bubble for 45 minutes (turning the meatballs a couple times). They were just great. I couldn&#39;t believe my daughter ate five of the twenty I made. My only suggestion is to take the time to make the meatballs evenly sized, and to be sure and mix the ingredients thoroughly before turning into meatballs. I suppose the only thing I changed was that I mixed only 3/4 cup of water to the ground beef and added two eggs. In the sauce I did not add the water at all, just the two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce, 4Tsp of Worchestershire sauce, and 4 Tbsp of brown sugar.15 of the 20 meatballs were eaten. Only due to stomach capacity of 3 satisfied Kansan&#39;s. We will make this more often. So easy!"

My son kept asking for more and normally you have to beg him to just take one more bite. I did make one change in the recipe, my husband does not like his food to be sweet so instead of the brown sugar I added about 1/2- 1 teaspoon of ginger, roughly, I did not measure. And I also made them in the pressure cooker without browning to save on time. Only had to cook them for 15-20 min. at 15 lbs of pressure."

This is one of our most favorite meatball recipe. The only thing I do different is add a little onion powder to the meatballs and I usually add a 8oz. can of tomato sauce because we like extra sauce. We love it withashed potatoes or potatoes I put through my river. DELICIOUS!!! We love the leftovers too :-)
