I would melt butter then add veggies and flour to cook, add broth and allow to simmer. It definitely needs salt and pepper and maybe something else. 3 cups of wild rice is too much, try 2 cups. Omit the wine, just use broth. This recipe just needed to be simplified and add some salt and it’s good. I made all those changes and it’s much better."

I did not put any mushrooms in it because my daughter doesn&#39;t like them. She doesn&#39;t have any objections to cream of mushroom soup but I used cream of chicken with herbs because it sounded good. The soup was very filling, more so than I expected. It was also very tasty. Because it made so much, I may get some mushrooms today and saute them to add to the soup and have again tonight. It will depend on how much I find in the fridge. If I make this again, it will be for more than 2 people."

I’m not a fan of mushrooms so I leave them out and use Cream of Chicken with Herbs (or Cream of Celery). I purée the soup with the 1/2 cup of broth (or wine). I also add a half cup of toasted blanched almond slivers. A little extra chicken and rice make a thicker soup (I use a wild rice blend). Everyone loves this soup!

We truly enjoyed this soup and the depth of flavor the wild rice gives.  The next time I make this, I will increase the amount of white wine for increased flavor.

To avoid the other reviewer&#39;s complaints of &#34;runny soup&#34;, I reduced the chicken broth to 1 1/2 quarts.  I only added 2 1/2 c. of wild rice because the 4oz. package only yielded that much.  The soup was a perfect consistency."

Hot, hearty, and delicious, perfect for a cold winter night. I cooked up some chicken thighs and used quick-make wild rice to make the process a little faster.

I had never cooked it until using it in this recipe. I ended up cooking some 5 minute long grain and wild rice (without the seasoning packet) to add to it and that made it yummy.

Make sure you don&#39;t skip the melted butter and flour mixture because that also will give the soup a thicker, heartier, creamier consistency.  I do that part differently than what the recipe says.  I use a small saucepan to melt the butter.  Then I add the flour and 1/2 cup broth (I actually use water) and bring it to a boil till it&#39;s thick &amp; pasty.  Then I add it to the soup mixture. Works great!  I also add 1 teaspoon of salt to the soup - and that is a personal preference."

I halved the recipe and used only 3 cups of chicken broth (the original would have called for 4 cups.) I did not have mushrooms on hand so I had to leave them out, as well as the chicken bouillon because I never use that. I loved the seasonings involved in this recipe, very yummy! I also left out the soup and just started the soup out with the original white sauce amounts called for in the recipe to compensate for no soup. ( I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1 cup milk, some chicken broth and a splash of vinegar.) Instead of precooking my rice I just added in 1/3 cup uncooked rice in the soup and cooked it until done. To add some more substance I threw in about 1/2 cup or so uncooked egg noodles. Very yummy and great topped with Parmesan cheese! Quick and easy and a nice change from traditional chicken noodle soup; will make again."
