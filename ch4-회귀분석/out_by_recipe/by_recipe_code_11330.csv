0,87,11330,Twice-Baked Potato Casserole,sp_aUSaElGf_11330_c_2CjWxhXRHwqEg6lVvTA026AWNiG,u_MK7F3PWf5xnV,Karen3353,1,1659648417,0,0,0,1,488,I definitely don’t recommend this recipe without some serious tweaking. The ratio of potatoes/bacon to sour cream/cheese is ridiculous. This might be good if you doubled the potatoes and halved the dairy or added a ton of other ingredients to cut down on the richness but otherwise it’s nearly inedible. I made it entirely as directed. Total bust.

I tweaked it to make it a meal. Cooked the potatoes in the crockpot while at work. I added cubed ham and used cheddar-jack cheese.  We added the sour cream and chives after baking. It was a satisfying meal that was so easy!  I hope the remainder freezes well, since we are empty nesters."

I know ahead of time that I won&#39;t use the amount of sour cream called for due to past experience of the overpowering taste when I&#39;ve made twice baked potatoes. My solution to that is to substitute French Onion chip dip for a portion of the sour cream. Not only does it eliminate the sour cream aftertaste but it adds a nice flavor to the potatoes! It&#39;s a simple, easy solution."

I use russets (well scrubbed with skins left on) because I prefer a starchy potato for this dish and use about 3 lbs. We get about 8 decent sized portions. Skimpy portions are not permitted in my kitchen. I prefer to cube the potatoes and roast them in a large baking dish before hand. I also double the amount of salt and black pepper to 1/2 tsp. Twice baked potatoes are a favorite of both my husband and me and this casserole hits the spot."

BTW, my preference was to cut back a little on the sour cream and cheese. I eliminated the mozzarella and used cheddar and jack, added a little garlic powder and chives. It was great with steak tips and green beans with mushrooms. This is a bona fide review because i actually made it."

Initially, our first thought was, it makes too much for our little family of two, so we decided to cut the recipe in half. It sounded delicious.Once it came out of the oven, that was a different story. The amount of bacon coupled with the sour cream overpowers the dish, so the balance of flavors is too rich. Because the potatoes are such a neutral flavor, they get lost in the casserole. Maybe if you use less of the sour cream and bacon, or more potatoes, that would be the right ratio of bacon to toppings. Also, the presentation wasn&#39;t very appealing, because the whiteness of the sour cream dominates the other colors.Sadly, this recipe will not be added to our recipe box. Happy cooking! :)"

And cutting them into 1&#34; cubes once they are baked is next to impossible. So before they even went into the oven to cook as a casserole, i&#39;d already spent nearly an hour on what was supposed to be a 15 min. prep time. Had my boys not told me how great it was &amp; what an awesome cook i am &amp; it actually taste REALLY good, i don&#39;t know if i&#39;d even have made it again.

I added more potatoes, sprinkled some scallions throughout and cooked it a little longer just to make sure the cheeses melted throughout.  It not only tasted great but looked like the picture too!  They can be made up ahead of time and can also be reheated the next day if you have any leftovers."

It is so much easier to put everything in a large bowl and mix it together and then put into baking dish.  Each and every morsel is coated and incredibly delicious.
