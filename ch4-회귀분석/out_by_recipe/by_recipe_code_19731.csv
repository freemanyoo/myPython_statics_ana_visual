I couldn’t decide whether to use vegetable vs chicken bouillon so did 1tsp of each. The tsp of hot sauce is NOT optional in my opinion, it’s a must. And no, it doesn’t make it spicy at all. I also added maybe an 1/8-1/4 tsp dry mustard (to give it that background kick like in beer cheese soup), 1/4 cup diced onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic into the veggies. I used sharp cheddar for the most flavor &amp; it came out perfect. Normally I’m always adding extra salt or bouillon to most soups but didn’t need to with this one. It was plenty thick without blending any of the veggies."

My family and I were very sick with Covid a few months ago. I was staying with my 19 month old grandson because my daughter and her husband were in the hospital having my granddaughter and due to some complications on top of them also having Covid, I was with him for almost a week. Many people dropped off meals and groceries for us. I was so nauseated with the sickness and couldn’t eat much of anything. My son-in-law’s mom made this for me using almond milk and it very much hit the spot. It is literally all I could eat for days.

It is one of my husband &amp; mine favorite. I try to use also low fat cheddar or sharp cheese to cut more fat. I also use sodium reduce better than bouillon.

I tasted it and it was really really good.  I husband wanted cauliflower soup and this was the best.  Don&#39;t leave out the celery because that really adds a lot of flavor.  I am on a kick of using almond milk because it&#39;s healthier than cream or half and half and it can stay in my fridge for 2 months whereas milk products need to be used.  The almond milk tastes no different.    The only thing I noticed was that it made so little soup.  So my review already said the recipe as stated is very good....BUT I added 2 potatoes, cooked, drained and mashed with a little butter and added to the soup with 2 cups of water and 1 T. soup base and 1 more cup of cheese.......When I go to the work of making a soup, I want more than just a couple meals for the 2 of us."

Added a little paprika and dry mustard.  Pressure cooked everything non dairy for 5 minutes and a 10 min natural release. Made the roux according to directions and folded it in.  Total hit. Next time I think I may add a splash of white wine or sherry and a potato.

I did make a few minor changes however.  First, I sauteed onion in olive oil, added the shredded carrot and cauliflower florets and sauteed for a few minutes with the onion.  Then I added chicken stock instead of water.  After I added the cheese sauce to the cauliflower, I used my immersion blender to make a more creamy thick soup.

So I  made some slight modifications second time around which prospective cooks may want to consider.  I added a lot more carrots and celery, around 1 cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves. I found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time I made it so next time I added the celery to the soup base 3 minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower. I also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce. i do like some kick to my soups so I added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time.  I used red pepper flakes second time as I thought the Tabasco Sauce turned the soup a bit too orange. I like the suggestion to add some chopped onions as well. I will try that next time just to keep tweaking the basic recipe,as apparently that is what I do!"

Watch the cooking time for veggies to avoid mushy texture. I cooked mine 10-minutes and thought cauliflower was a bit too soft. Have cheese sauce ingredients measured and ready once the pot of vegges are truned on, this goes together quickly.
