I don&#39;t really change anything.  The only adjustment I made is that I now use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and I use skim milk instead of whole milk just because it is what we drink.  It makes a thinner soup which is fine but the original recipe is probably better but still great flavor either way.  I also quit measuring everything.  I just add as much or as little of everything that I want.  Always good.  It&#39;s hard to screw up.

It is absolutely fantastic!  I have been making it since I first saw it in the TOH magazine years ago.  I do use much finer chopped onions (practically minced) and smaller pieces of ham, but I don&#39;t change anything as far as ingredients.  You can use canned potatoes and carrots if you are crunched for time.
BUT, how disappointing that the editors have not included this recipe in the all of the soup recipes -- with two posts about the &#34;80 best soups&#34;, how could this one not make it???  Maybe I missed it...
Anyway, this recipe if a KEEPER!  Yum!"

Since TOH doesn&#39;t have the option to make notes, here goes. I made this heart healthy by deleting the bacon and sautéing the onion and carrot in olive oil. After that, I added chicken that I had baked separately and used 2% milk and 2% reduced fat cheese. I followed all of the other directions. My family loved it."

I added two sticks of chopped celery, grated my carrots and used red potatoes. I had one cup of heavy cream I wanted to use up so I made the difference with the whole milk.

I had a problem getting my diced potatoes to consistently soften up so the next time I make it I will be sure to cook them in a separate pan and add them in at the last minute with the cheese and ham.  This was a good use of some leftover ham steak and I also had two leftover ears of sweet corn I used rather than the canned corn.  I could have used an extra ear.  My only other substitution was to use two 4 oz blocks of Velveeta cheese cubed up as I did not have shredded cheese on hand and this melts in better anyway.  It is tasty and no celery that my husband would prefer I not use!

I would prepare meals for myself then take half to my 91 year old mother and she so loved this soup that she requested it at least once a month.  I ran out of cheese once and It is great even without the cheese.  I moved mother in with me when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she eventually got to the point she could no longer chew.  I would then blend this soup so she could just swallow and still have the nourishment.  Now that she has passed, I always think of her when I make this as this was her favorite.

Definite keeper to make again on a chilly winter night. I was slightly confused on the cheese because 3 cups would be 24 ounces, but the recipe says 12 ounces...I used 2 8oz bags and it was fine. I&#39;m not sure in our house there is such a thing as too much cheese! :)"

I had frozen some homemade chicken stock,  (which I always save when I am making enchiladas or casseroles with cooked chicken) and milk in place of water and bouillon, and as I only had 2 cups cheddar when I made it the first time, I added a cup of Colby-Jack I had on hand. It was so good I decided to use the same combo again. The first time I used a whole, drained can of Niblets, and the second time a heaping cup of frozen corn, thawed. Both worked great.

The answer to your question is.. are you using cheese that is already shredded? I found this out the hard way when I was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese. If you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesn&#39;t stick together. Also you don&#34;t really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store. So freshness does matter. It is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself. Since I have been doing that, all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly. I got this tip from Paula Dean. It was a question she answered from her cooking magazine. I hope this helped you."

It tastes just as delicious as the first time when it turned out perfectly, but looks very unappetizing. I tell my kids..just eat it with your eyes closed! LOLAny suggestions would be so appreciated. After cooking for 50 years, this is frustrating.  Thank you!"

When it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones.  We usually use matchstick carrots so we don&#39;t have to chop.  IF we use bacon we use real bacon pieces (such as Hormel) like you can find in the salad section of the store.  We usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since I don&#39;t have bacon grease to use.  Because I use canned potatoes I only heat it through before I add the ham and cheese.  The whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers.
