I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was still way too sweet. I’ll omit the sugar next time. I’d consider this a dessert rather than a side dish but it’s good. Note if you make this with cheese, it will be slightly less firmer than without so you may want to lessen a liquid ingredient maybe the milk."

I eventually quit making it some years back and now my youngest daughter who is now out in her own tries to make it. The problem is that the industry has changed the cornbread mix formula and they just aren’t the same as the ones from back when when this recipe was really popular (which is what prompted me to just stop making it). Corn pudding is a tried and true, it’s today’s mixes that can mess it up."
