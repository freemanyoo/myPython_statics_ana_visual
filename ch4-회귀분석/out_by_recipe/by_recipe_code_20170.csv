Try medium.  Not too hot and definately more flavor than tomatoes.  About the sodium content by I reviewer. Try making your own .  There are Lots of recipes online  but basically 1 T. Each :cumin, chilli powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and a scant TOregano. (1/4t. salt is optional. )  I round up the cumin just a bit and go a bit scant one the chili powder .But a mix of regular and  chipolte chilli powder  is good too. That will taste just like the envelope or BETTER according to reviews  Plus no sodium. Also look for fat free refried beans... 85 % lean or ground turkey (needs a tad more seasoning) lowers the fat.  These swaps do not chang the flavor at all. ADD in stuff  include corn., jalapenos . Olives. .

My current changes were: I used whole wheat flour tortillas, venison burger (about 1 1/2 pounds), TWO packets of taco seasoning. 4 cups (2- 8oz bags) of shredded Mexican cheese. We also added sour cream and guacamole as a garnish.Things I will do differently next time I make it: I will use sliced GREEN onions in beef mixture AND as a garnish. I will use a tub of fresh salsa instead of Mexican diced tomatoes, and when I do that I will delete the 2/3 cup water, because fresh salsa has way more juice than a can of diced tomatoes. And I would definitely break up the top layer of tortilla&#39;s and spread them evenly, cuz those were tough to cut. I had to perforate them with a sharp knife to get an even cut. Even sprinkled with cheese and baked they were not soft enough to cut pieces with the spatula.Other than my changes, this was an awesome first time recipe for us and we liked it!"

I replaced the green pepper with 1/2 can of green chiles, and I used sharp cheddar cheese.  I also used brown rice tortillas as one person does not eat wheat.  I may try corn tortillas next time.   This is a good recipe.  Thanks for sharing it."

I used diced tomatoes with green chilies b/c I couldn&#39;t find the Mexican ones.  The sauce was really spicy in the pan but cooled off in the mix of the casserole.

So did my two girls... my 18-month old ate as big of a piece as I did and asked for more!  I will definitely be making this again!  UPDATE 5/2/2014:  I make this dish on a regular basis, still a family favorite.  However, this recipe fills a 9x13 casserole dish which is a little too much for us to eat in a couple of days.  What I&#39;ve started doing is mixing all of the filling together - ground beef, onion, pepper, water, taco seasoning, black beans and diced tomatoes - I also started mixing in the refried beans so it&#39;s simpler to put together and the taste is the same :-)  Then I divide the entire recipe in half.  I use 3 tortillas, half the filling and half the cheese and make up a 8x8 dish.  Then I take the remaining half of just the filling and freeze it in a freezer container.  Next time I want to make this dish, I defrost the filling and then make another 8x8 casserole.  Works perfect for my family!"
