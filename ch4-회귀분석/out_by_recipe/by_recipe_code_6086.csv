As with any recipe, tweaking may be needed to suit your personal tastes, and reading the directions carefully is also mandatory.  When reading reviews, I noticed several folks complaining about their pie being under-done, then saw one lady who said she had to add time to the initial 25 minutes, when the recipe specifically calls for an additional 20-25 mins, after foil is removed.  I suspect more than one person undercooked their pie by not reading the recipe correctly."

I have been baking almost my entire life, usually using my mom&#39;s recipe.  After she passed away, I was unable to replicate it, but THIS is DARN close.  I only use granny smith apples, I use less sugar and brown sugar (slightly less than half a cup per pie), a bit more cinnamon, about the same nutmeg and flour. I skip the ginger, as I don&#39;t think the pie needs it. I don&#39;t care for a pie that is TOO sweet, so I am pretty liberal with the lemon juice.  (I might add a teaspoon more of flour, depending on how crazy I went with the lemon juice.)  I generally don&#39;t sugar the crust, but that is my preference.  I made two apple and two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year, and needless to say, there were NO leftovers.  To those that have a problem with the filling being too wet, I suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples.  The peel should be dark green.  If the texture of the apple is &#34;mealy&#34;, it is over ripe and will probably be too wet.  Thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom."

Well, my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so, it was the right time to just go for it. I chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward. I did read through many of the reviews, which are very mixed--from best pie to worst pie. Honestly, that made me a little nervous, but I decided to remain positive and give it a shot. The result was spectacular!!! I had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy. He said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice. I took the next slice, and I was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how  well everything came out.  I will note that I followed the directions, without any changes. I used only Granny Smith apples and I didn&#39;t have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough. The pie&#39;s taste is amazing. I thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly. Honestly, the hardest part for me was making the crust, which I also decided to do for the first time. I was actually worried most about the double crust, but it somehow all worked out. Phew!

It&#39;s a great way to make sure it doesn&#39;t come out watery. I used extra sugar and just under 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I didn&#39;t even need to use the entire thing (spices (sea salt, ginger, nutmeg,  cinnamon, white sugar)and cornstarch mixture) . I noticed a lot of complaining in the comments about undercooked apples so I cooked everything together first and the cornstarch did its job to create a thick sauce right from the get-go. It just finished baking so I&#39;m at the cooling stage now.

So I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious. I will critique it though. Ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste. It definitely came out liquid-y however I found when you let it cool for about 45 mins the liquid becomes less runny. I used a Pillsbury pie crust. Phenomenal. I did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery. Didn’t really change anything.

Pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end, if they’re browning too quickly. Time given is not long enough to cook the filling. It needs twice as long as stated here. It also needs a higher starting temperature. It should be baked at 425 degrees for the first 20 minutes then turned down to 375 degrees to bake for a further 40 minutes or so. Also, I used Bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so I’d increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy."

I didn&#39;t measure out my lemon juice. I honestly just poured whatever the apples needed :D I actually really liked a little bit of that lemon flavor. I would recommend some more some cinnamon, but I really love cinnamon so that&#39;s your choice lol. I used a pre-made frozen pie crust, and as you can see, it worked out great. Ovbiously, I had to buy some more to get the top covered. I recommend to not be shy with the egg whites! I brushed all the egg white on the top, and I&#39;m glad I did. I thought about not using all of it, but I did, and got a great pie. All in all, this was the most awesome pie ever! SO glad I found this recipe. &lt;3"

It was the first homemade pie I ever made, but the recipe was easy, it included items I usually already have in the kitchen, and it didn&#39;t take much time to prep. However, I only had Gala apples which made the pie perfectly sweet, but not too sweet. I didn&#39;t have any ginger so I missed out on that intended kick the recipe included. The top layer of my crust was still raw after 25 mins, so I added 13 more minutes...it was then half- undercooked, so I added 10 more minutes and adjusted to 400 degrees. Maybe I had the pie on a rack too low in the oven. All I know that in the end, it was delicious!"

My daughter received a school assignment to bak an apple pie, so this is the one we chose. I only made one change; I didn&#39;t have any cardamon so I sprinkled I a pinch of all-spice instead. The pie took longer to bake than directed, but the end result was worth the wait! I found the Taste of Home pie notes listed right after the recipe helpful, and also followed one of the the reviewer&#39;s recommendations to use heaping tablespoons full of flour. The pie wasn&#39;t runny or dry; it was just perfect! The only change I will make next time is to add another cup pf apples. I used 7 cups of thinly sliced honey crisps, but they cooked down quite a bit.

About apples, if you live in an area that has fresh picked apples you are very lucky.  Apples after being stored lose moisture and this will cause your pie to be dry unless you add a little fluid or less flour.  Used fresh picked Granny Smith (4) and only (2) Honeycrisp because they were huge and so sweet and tart too.  All in all, this 85 year old man is glad he found this recipe."

I used my favorite go-to homemade pastry dough recipe for the crust. I used 4 granny smith apples and 2 honeycrisp apples .  That combination was perfect for us. Just the right amount of tart and sweet. TIP FOR ALL: If you dont want runny pies heres what to do; Mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice, let sit for at least 30 minutes, dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan, boil it gently for about 5-10 minutes to form a syrup (you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed) let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar, mix well then add your flour. This works every single time with every kind of pie. You will not have any more runny pie filling. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"

I used my own pie crust recipe though because it is tried and true.  Two tips abou the pie filling.  1). I used a combination of Jonagold and Granny Smith apples but increased the amount of apple to 9 cups.  This was just right for the stated amount of sugar, flour, and seasoning.  Juicy but not runny.  2). Baking time needs to be increased substantially.  I started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done.  Baked another 30 minutes, checking frequently to be sure it was not over baking.  Apples should be nice and &#34;oozy&#34; and very tender.  With these two minor modifications, fabulous results!"

That might vary based on the top of apple.My crust turned out great! But even with 5 extra minutes, my apples still weren&#39;t tender enough. I used Honeycrisp and a few golden delicious. I wish now that I&#39;d either tried another reviewer&#39;s tip of covering the whole top with tin foil (so I could have baked it longer), or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for 5  minutes to give them a head start. P.S. I probably would have chosen Jonathans or Jonagolds if my store had them. :-/"

First homemade apple pie and it came out the best I&#39;ve had in my life and that&#39;s not just because I made it haha. There were a few different changes I made and that is 1. I used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container. 2. I skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking. I know it&#39;s not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust. 3. I substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor.  Also I forgot to set the timer and didn&#39;t read the cover with foil part so I accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about 45 minutes. Apples weren&#39;t mushy but also not hard . Right in the middle. I used janigolds and  Mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard.

It was quick and easy to make and had the perfect combination of spices. Also, for those of you who were wondering, you&#39;d need about 5 regular sized apples.The only thing I would change is the sugar, it was a bit too much for my family. I would cut one of the sugars in half, also I did not listen others and increase the flour, but It may have helped the runnyness. It was not runny per say but could have used a bit of extra thickener.  Lastly I made this in a regular round metal cake pan with the same cooking time and it worked out great.

My supreme critic, Wifey, said she would have used a couple of Macs or Fujis, thought a couple of apple slices were a little hard - though she gobbled it down. First time for me with a two crust pie. Will add a Fuji or two in the next attempt with this wonderful recipe.Which will be soon. With ice cream maybe? Perfect on its own.  I used a &#34;1-2-3&#34; crust recipe listed on the net.

It&#39;s way, way, way too runny.  I should have read the reviews in addition checking the star rating.  So if you&#39;re getting ready to bake this pie, do NOT dump the coated apples onto the pie crust under any circumstances (unless you like apple pie soup)."

I did add extra flour to thicken as well (will probably add more next time perhaps an extra 2T) Also added a couple of sprinkles of watkins apple pie spice. Kids probably would have eaten it all if I had let them. I may reduce the sugar a tad next time but still enjoyed just the same.
