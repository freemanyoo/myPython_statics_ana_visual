Very easy, and a nice change from banana bread for those bananas that are getting ripe. The combination of bananas and sour cream make for a very moist cake. I agree with the other reviews, with the cream cheese frosting being the perfect topping. I will make this recipe again."

They were delicious, I added a half banana to the icing. I wasn&#39;t sure if the banana would turn the icing a weird color or texture but it turned out great. Next time I will add an entire banana. My icing was a little sticky (meaning it came off a little on the cellophane when transporting it), I&#39;m guessing I could have added more confectioners sugar, but it just seemed like a &#34;ton&#34; of sugar. Regardless, it was great! Next time I will also add the 2 T. of whipping cream as mentioned below. Thanks for the recipe!"

A few pieces of walnuts sprinkled on each piece was a great addition for those who like nuts.    kbbradford&#39;s review (below this one) has a great hint....add the 2 T. whipping cream to the frosting, because it does make a wonderfully smooth and creamy frosting and it is oh so easy to spread."

I used 1 cup almond flour, 1 cup regular instead of just regular flour. I used 2 sticks of butter, 4 eggs, 5 extremely ripe bananas, a splash of whole milk and oat milk instead of sour cream. I added cinammon and pecan crumbles to the cake, and I used brown sugar. I put the cake in a Bundt pan. The icing was perfect with on 2 cups confectioners sugar, and extra vanilla. This cake was so moist and impressive! So I guess you could say that this recipe provided the foundation for where I went with it, but what I got was fabulous!"

I always cut the sugar in half and add a smidgen of stevia leaf powder in order to trim calories and fat from recipes; especially from sugar filled desserts. My bananas were small so I used 3 and mashing them gave me a bit more than a cup.  I also use a non-egg egg replacer because of allergies to eggs.  Some recipes don&#39;t turn out as well using egg replacer but this one turned out beautifully!  I also use an icing sugar made with tapioca flour; due to allergies.  I used half the icing sugar and added about 1/2 cup tapioca flour to help with the volume and DID NOT add in any stevia.  There was still enough frosting to cover the bars and it was still plenty sweet.  Some reviews mentioned that the recipe didn&#39;t make 4 dozen but it does!  I cut into 6 rows (10 inch side) by 8 rows (15 inch side).  They were the perfect size!  I took them to a large gathering and received many compliments on them.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

I wanted to make these for church this morning so was worried about time but they went together quickly and I love that they also bake and cool quickly. I used 4 frozen medium bananas and it was just barely over 1 cup. Used the liquid too that comes with freezing bananas. I used a half sheet pan, I think 15-1/2 x 11-1/4, and it was the perfect size for bar thickness. Baked mine for 23 minutes, rotating pan with 8 minutes left. One rack lower than middle of oven. Nice medium brown on top. Put in the cold garage to cool quickly. I had about 1-1/2 cups of leftover cream cheese frosting I&#39;d used for cookies. Very thick so added maybe a good half a cup of soured milk till the right consistency for a glaze. Spread over the mostly cooled bars, cut into 40 bars which yielded 2 inch sized bars. They were gobbled up at church and we still had some to bring home. My family loved them! These will be my go to banana recipe. I loathe making banana bread so these are banana goodies I will make often."

Should I only pour half the batter in, and then make again? Found this to be more cake-like than bar-like. I also put it in for 35 minutes because the middle was too pudding-like, though I was nervous about the browning edges (I live at high-altitude if that&#39;s relevant). Overall, an easy winner to take to work or a family gathering. I put salted caramel in the cream cheese frosting which was amazing. I will try enhancing it even more with another banana or some almonds next time."

Were a big hit!!  I also think I would cut the frosting recipe in half (I only used 3/4 of it), or maybe add less powdered sugar so not so sweet.  I will definately make these again.  Nice change from the usual banana bread!!  Would also be deliscious with the tiny chocolate chips, or adding peanut butter to the frosting also."
