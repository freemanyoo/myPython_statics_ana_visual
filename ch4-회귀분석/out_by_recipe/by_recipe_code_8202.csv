I make it regularly (every couple of weeks) and I get no complaints. In fact, I usually double the recipe because my roommate wants plenty of leftovers. I accidentally added the taco seasoning in towards the end one time and it didn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference. It was just slightly less flavorful but it was still good. I usually add seasonings to the ground beef, as I fry it, and I put different beans in it but that&#39;s it. It comes out delicious every time."

We topped with green onions, cheese &amp; avocado. I definitely would have added more rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilis) if I had the extra can.

Our family does like a little extra flavour in our food, so we usually add more spices than a recipe calls for. And I did add a few extras to make more soup to last longer with portions to freeze for later. Apart from the basic recipe: I added 1 can black beans, 1 diced green pepper, 1 diced white onion, 1/2 can leftover tomato soup (just to avoid wasting it.) Some cumin, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, parsley, adobo seasoning, chipotle chile powder, and about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and some more water. I added black olives to mine but not the entire pot, because a lot of people hate olives. I love them though and they are a great addition! Then we topped as desired with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crushed tortilla chips when serving. It worked out great. This recipe is versatile in how you can add to it or adjust it to make it work for you / stretch it for extra servings. I would have never thought about using the ranch dressing packet but that was a good idea."

I should have noticed when it called for almost all canned ingredients that it would not be too tasty.  Basically you just throw all the ingredients together and hope for the best. I had to add an extra pack of taco seasoning so that this soup could have a better taste then just canned beans and tomatoes. I also added sugar because the ranch dressing adds a sour taste to the soup that I had to cover up and some chili garlic sauce to give it a kick. I would suggest to omit the ranch dressing all together. Matter of fact, throw the whole recipe away and try again."

What hungry adult is  going to eat only 1 cup? A doctor at the Mayo Clinic is quoted as telling us (who are NOT on a low salt diet) to consume 2000 mg of salt for the WHOLE day so with a cup and a half you will be eating more than is healthy. It may be delicious but I&#39;ll have to pass.

Also sprinkle taco cheese on top and sliced black olives when served."

My mom is on a low sodium diet so we used Old el Paso 30% less sodium taco seasoning. I also used reduced sodium pinto beans and no salt canned corn and stewed tomatoes. Didn&#39;t compromise on taste at all! Served it with sour cream, sliced black olives and reduced fat shreaded cheddar cheese as toppings. Family loved it, my picky eaters. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It&#39;s a winner!"

I added some elbow macaroni and left out the diced tomatoes with chiles. My husband and I both have acid reflux. I still enjoyed the Taco mix without all the extra hot ingredients. It is yummy.
