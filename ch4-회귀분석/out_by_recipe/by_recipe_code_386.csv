I bake in a 9 inch pan for 25 minutes (check with a toothpick 5 minutes before the directions state - you don&#39;t want a dry cake).

They have all turned out great!  I like this cake because it is structurally sound and can withstand icing like a champ. Use a long bread knife to slice off the slight dome.

After greasing glass cake pan, I sprinkled it with sugar before adding batter.  And, for me cake took longer to bake than 30 minutes while increased baking time gradually.

I baked it 25 mins.  Probably could have used another couple of minutes. And I should have used butter and flour in the pan instead of spray (it did stick). But my son and I were instantly addicted! My only changes were using whole milk (all I had) and adding a pinch of salt (and btw...I also used regular salted butter too). This came together so quickly! And it is perfect eaten warm!

The recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake. Only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar. After that, use a spatula to mix everything else in, because if you continue to use a mixer you&#39;ll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture, which will make it less fluffy. Also add the milk and butter before the flour, because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture. If you prefer something less sweet, use 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 2. You could also melt the butter first, before stirring in the milk, just to make it melt faster."

Nice basic ingredients that I already had, and a simple recipe. Wanted to start a little tradition with my young daughters that they could pass on —making a simple cake from scratch.  While it was a little sweet for my own taste, they absolutely loved it. The texture was spongy and moist, and the plain cake was a hit solo. I also made a berry compote to add a bit of tartness for my own preference (and my mom’s) and the girls loved that too. I guess the key is in proper mixing.    Not a fake review! There were a couple negative reviews from so-called “baking professionals” that said the cake turned out awful or that the positive reviews were not genuine. Real mom here."

I added a T of vanilla bean paste plus the t of vanilla. I used half and half instead of 2%. I beat the eggs a long time until they were light and fluffy and then added the sugar and beat again until light and fluffy for quite a bit. My batter was smooth and creamy. I baked this in a glass baking dish so I reduced my oven temp to 335. When it was done and cooled I made a fresh blueberry compote to serve on top with a dollop of homemade whipped cream but refrigerated whipped topping would work just as well. I liked it because it’s a light dessert without heavy frosting to hold it down. Perfect for a light spring or summer supper.

I have made it numerous times and it comes out perfectly every time. I don&#39;t understand how it doesn&#39;t come out for others. I make a could of small tweaks. I use unsalted butter for all of my baking, so I added a teaspoon of salt and whisked it together with the flour, baking power and salt before adding them to the batter. I used twice the vanilla. Also, I think it makes a big difference if you add ingredients very gradually. Make sure an addition of flour is almost completely incorporated before adding the next."

I went to a baking academy, and I&#39;ve been baking for more than 5 years.) If you&#39;re looking for fluffy hot milk cake, definitely do not try this recipe. If you&#39;re up to really dense, dense, cake, maybe you could try this recipe.

The texture is both spongy and slightly dense at the same time.  I followed other reviewers&#39; suggestions to add a smidge more vanilla and a pinch of salt.  I did also add about 1/2 tsp. of rum extract because I thought the batter tasted good, but needed a little... something!  You could really use this cake as a base and add any type of extract or flavoring you&#39;re in the mood for.   I also agree with the others who said it&#39;s very important to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes, maybe even a little longer.  I also made sure I beat the sugar and eggs until they were nice and airy too.  35 minutes in the oven was perfect.  The cake tastes great on its own--especially when it&#39;s still warm--but I plan on serving  it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream later.  Can&#39;t wait!"

For taste I would give it 4.  I am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes I made below.If someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe, but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize and/or correct the following:Salt:  Salt is necessary UNLESS you are using salted butter.  Most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe.  This recipe may have been written for use with salted butter, but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted, it will come out bland without the addition of salt. I added 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect.Batter: My batter was unusually runny, I would even call it watery. I have made cakes with very runny batter previously, but I was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didn&#39;t mention the consistency of the batter. I added 1/2 cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise. Your results may vary, however."

When I read the recipe, I was skeptical, as I had never heard of hot milk cake. I decided to try it because of all the great reviews. It was a bit more work than my usual yellow cake recipe, but it was well worth it! This is the fluffiest cake I have ever made. It was moist and light. I followed the recipe exactly. I think that beating the eggs for the full five minutes is essential. I made two 8x8 cakes and froze one for another day. I served the other one with fresh strawberries and light whipped cream. My husband raved about it. This is my new favourite cake recipe!"
