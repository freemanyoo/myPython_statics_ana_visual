Making homemade versions of store bought items is what I like. This recipe does just that with the teriyaki sauce.

I am diabetic after chemo and radiation so try to cut sugar when I can!  I got a new crock pot and set it for 5 hours time. Had bone in thighs. Keep taking lid off and flipping thighs to keep ladling sauce on top several times during cooking. When I went to remove chicken with two tine fork it fell apart and the bone fell back into pot!   Oh my gracious the sauce is good enough to eat by itself lol!!  Fantastic recipe. Made baby broccoli florets with sharp cheddar cheese instead of rice  It was a great meal. So easy to make!!!

If it runs hot, you will not need 4-5 hours. I cooked it for four, but I will cook it for about three hours next time.  I didn&#39;t move the chicken to a platter. I kept it in the crockpot and threw in a bag of frozen broccoli while I made the sauce. After the sauce was made, I poured it back over the chicken/broccoli while the rice was cooking.

I just made this and can&#39;t stress to you how delicious this was. I adjusted the recipe because I didn&#39;t have 3 lbs of chicken. I had less than 2 lbs so I reduced the amount it called for by half. I also didn&#39;t use the low sodium soy sauce since I didn&#39;t have any on hand. I just used the regular and it tasted fine so I&#39;m not sure why everyone commented on how salty it was. Must try!

The first time I followed the recipe exactly; the chicken was over cooked and the sauce seemed bland.

I did tweak the recipe, in part because of personal preference but also because I used what I had on hand. I used about 4lbs of boneless skinless thighs. Following the advice of other reviewers, I used brown sugar instead of white. I also added honey and grated some ginger into the mixture. I substituted rice vinegar for apple cider vinegar and cooked on low in the crockpot for just under 3 hours.  Also, I found that I needed to double the cornstarch mixture at the end to get a good thickness. Served over quinoa and steamed broccoli and it was a big hit."

But I knew that and cooked for 2 hrs and 15 min.  Like many I used brown sugar and added a couple more pieces of garlic.  It turned out really well but as written it would have been like eating shoe leather.  Most crock-pots heat differently so pull out a piece at 2 hrs and see if the internal temp is reaching 160 degrees.  if so, they are ready to eat."

First as for taste, it is good but for my family possibly too sweet.  For clarity, I did take the advice of other reviewers and use light brown sugar instead of white which I think is essential if you want a true teriyaki flavor.  However, the sugar definitely needs to be adjusted and cut down.  Second, I also had the same problem as other reviewers in not being able to get the sauce to properly thicken as expected.  There was just too much of if and I used a little over three pounds of chicken thighs.  I served it with rice and there was PLENTY of sauce to go round and then some!  Finally, the cook time is way off.  Luckily I had read the reviews and noted this issue.  My chicken was done at 3 hours so I moved the crock-pot setting over to warm.  If you cook this the full time stated in the recipe you will get over-done dry chicken.  As I mentioned, this recipe as potential but could use some tweaking."

I didn&#39;t use my crockpot because it over cooks the chicken.  I browned the chicken in a little olive oil, then I drained the grease and cooked the chicken in the sauce until done.
