Don’t rate it until you try it!  And  for heavens sake, don’t change an ingredient  ie quick oatmeal to old fashioned and blame the recipe if your cookies are dry.

The dough was really dry and I hoped the cookies would be less so as the butter melted, but they weren&#39;t. It might have been because I used old fashion oats instead of quick-cooking. Running the old fashion oats through the food processor might have helped with the texture. I really dislike crisp cookies so I made them a little bigger than the rounded tsp and baked them for 8 minutes, but found even that to be too long! I ended up baking for 6 minutes and letting cool on the cookie sheet for 1.5 minutes before removing to a wire rack. They didn&#39;t really spread at all. I used chocolate pudding mix because that&#39;s what I had and I think it was too chocolatey; I also decreased the chips to 1.5 cups. Sorry, but I won&#39;t be repeating these.

A recipe with 1 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups flour plus the 3 cups of oatmeal is pretty standard and should make 3-4 dozen cookies.  Since they tell you this recipe makes 7 dozen, it means they are tiny cookies, bite sized.  So, yes, the calories and fat PER COOKIE is less.....but so is the cookie.   Now, if we can eat just one.....but, I would want more than one.  How about you?  "

I have replaced my old recipe for this one.  This is a keeper!  My husband love the dough and my children love the cookies.  With all my cookies, I will use my pampered chef mini scoop and make cookie dough balls and line them up on a baking sheet.  Then freeze them until hard.  I then store the dough balls in a marked ziploc bag in the freezer.  This way, we can have homemade cookies whenever we want and not have to bake 6 or 7 dozen."

My whole family loved these chewy cookies. I only got 3 dozen cookies instead of the 7 the recipe suggests so the recipe cookies must be bite-size cookies. YUMMY-YUMMY!!!

I brought some to a party this weekend and everybody said the same thing.   They are delicious!   I made them with mini-chocolate chips instead.   This is now the only oatmeal cookie for me and my family.
