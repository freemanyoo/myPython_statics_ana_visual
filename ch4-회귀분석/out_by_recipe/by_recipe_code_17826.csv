I made this exactly as written. It was so easy to put together and so good. It was even better reheated for leftovers. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It could have many substitutions as in meat or cheese and perhaps veggies thrown in. I could not get over how flavor filled it was. Just a total joy to put in my mouth.

Used a swiss/gruyere cheese combo, and some cheddar.  It still was very bland, and I think that was due to the potatoes, which really need to be cooked first in order to have any flavor.  Otherwise, the potatoes just overpower everything else in it."

*EDIT 4/11/22*Made this tonight for dinner. We don&#39;t really care for Swiss cheese and we couldn&#39;t find Gruyere, so I subbed about 3/4 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano and I used scallions instead of white, sweet onion because they give egg dishes a metal taste. Didn&#39;t need, but a half of a teaspoon of kosher salt and about a teaspoon of white pepper. I also added some diced green pepper and we both loved it. Next time I will grate some fresh garlic and sauté the vegetables separately from the bacon. Delicious! Definitely a keeper!"

I didn&#39;t mix it altogether but built it like a quiche: Meat/onions/spinach mixture on the bottom, Monterey Jack cheese and then the egg, cheese and cottage cheese mixture. Topped it with more jack cheese. And, I baked it in my 9&#34; x 9&#34; ceramic dish and it was amazing. I was a little reluctant to serve it for breakfast as it might be a better lunch or dinner entree but hubby thought it was terrific.

Use a slightly larger casserole dish and do NOT use frozen anything. When the recipe states 3/4 cup - use 1 full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven. Also, the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish. We will place (lightly) a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first 30 minutes so it won&#39;t crust over too badly. PLUS, the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your family&#39;s tastes.  BUEN PROVECHO"

I&#39;ve been looking for a great breakfast casserole for years - and this is truly wonderful. I made it initially for a weekly teacher breakfast at my school.  I thought I had made too much - instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left!  My only complaint is that I found it to be just a little bland.  (The recipe calls for no additional spices...which I thought was sort of odd.)  I browned the hash browns (which takes forever, good lord), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  (I made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before I left for work - this also turned out quite well!)  The second time I made it (tonight), I added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture.  I also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and I love to the eggs and into the whole mixture.  (Just a few dribbles.)  I basically added blindly.  It turned out SO WELL.  Just gave it enough heat to be interesting, but not overpowering.  My hot sauce is not for the faint of heart...so if you&#39;re using something less insane like Frank&#39;s or Sriracha, you made need more.  Additionally, my Swiss cheese bag was 1 1/2 cups...I figured extra cheese makes everyone happier, and I just added all of it. :D I think there&#39;s a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy.  But seriously: MAKE THIS.  IT&#39;S DA BOMB."

My father in law and husband who are not fans of cottage cheese LOVED it and wouldn&#39;t have even known there was cottage cheese in there.  I have also used part skim cheese and it didn&#39;t make a significant difference just to make recipe lighter. I had a bag of potatoes to use up one time and chopped them into chunks and boiled them, drained, and used the recipe as is and they were delicious if you are looking to not use the frozen bag ones.Both ways are phenomenal but the skim substitutes makes per serving a bit lighter for those who are not looking for those who are watching their waist line =) excellent recipe and is a go to when I have a huge brunch and family visiting in town!"

I made this for supper for my adult son and I the other night. I had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title. I used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms from Costco - which I fried with the onions - in the same pan as I had fried the bacon (I used low sodium), separately. I added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper (my son loves it) but didn&#39;t add salt as I felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough. Seeing as I hadn&#39;t made this before I didn&#39;t make any other changes - unusual for me. It was a wholesome meal! I accompanied it with a dish of stewed, herb and spice whole tomatoes - but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available - I might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings. I will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes I make. Another reviewer&#39;s comment about using salsa is an option. Before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so I sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese. I was pleased with the result (I don&#39;t like food as hot/spicy as my son), and my son thought it was an improvement. He wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish - adding a bit more of both than I&#39;d put on the one I reheated. Obviously a personal preference. He also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies. I&#39;ll also add the whole 500g container of cottage cheese (that&#39;s 1/2 cup more than in this recipe), as we both love cheese.  Really pleased to find this recipe  - thanks Beth Notaro for sharing! It reminds me of an Old Order Mennonite friend I had who died too early a few years ago with cancer. I&#39;m sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be making this countless times with numerous variations - as well as ones close to the original. I like the idea that it&#39;s bread and gluten free as I have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten."

I didn&#39;t have Swiss cheese so I didn&#39;t use it and truth be told, we didn&#39;t miss it.  I think the extra cheese would have made it too rich and greasy.  I baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in my oven (likely due to the extra eggs).  The addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise, but I didn&#39;t even notice it was there.  If anything, it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry.  This is a great gluten-free recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread.  I also prepped this dish in a pan and let it sit overnight before baking in the morning.  Next time, I might add a small can of green chiles to the mix.

It was even better baking it in my cast iron pan- nicely browned on the bottom. This will be in our breakfast rotation!"

I made a half batch, just in case we didn&#39;t care for it, and it was GONE in no time.  I&#39;ve been looking for a simple breakfast recipe to serve Thanksgiving morning and this is it!  I used breakfast sausage in place of the bacon and I skipped the onions on accident - still, it was just perfect.  It&#39;s like a cheesy quiche meets yummy scrambled eggs.  Thanks for sharing!"

I like sauteing my onions in the bacon drippings. I added chopped bell pepper and used the cheeses I had on hand (no swiss). It is an easy recipe and is easy to make changes to fit what is in your pantry.

This casserole is a big hit and by using some of the easier ways to get ingredients it is not hard to make.  I have never tried to freeze this but since I am making one for Sunday I may try freezing a small amount to see how it holds up."

Each week a team cooks breakfast every Sunday during the year.  My husband and I take turns choosing what we want to fix.  This is high on my list as the cottage cheese makes it so moist and delicious.I vary on the Cheddar cheese and use what I have on hand, sometimes I may add two or more different cheeses when I make a triple batch. I add different meats as well, to the casserole depending what is on sale at the store.  This is always a big hit with our parish of 45 people.We charge a $2.00 donation to cover the cost of the meal and what money is over the cost goes back to the Church. As my husband would say, &#34; The best $2.00 breakfast in town. Diane Chambers"
