This was a good basic recipe and worth keeping.  A great template or just fine as is!     I added the salt after I melted the cheese just because  I didn&#39;t have a full cup of cheddar and made up the difference with processed cheese which tends to be saltier.  In fairness, the recipe states after you uncover the potatoes that the cooking time will be 30 - 40 minutes or longer if your potatoes aren&#39;t tender.   In my experience, it does usually ends up taking about two hours.  Is it my oven, the thickness of the potatoes, or the type of potato?  Who knows!  What I know is that like the recipe and  I would make this again."

It’s tricky to find that perfect balance between firm and mushy potatoes, but the recipe as followed yielded crunchy potatoes. Thus, I increased the heat and the cooking time. I used Gruyère and white cheddar, sautéed shallots, and in addition to salt and pepper, added my secret makes-every-recipe-amazing spice blend for flavor (<a href=""https://silkroadspices.ca/products/scarborough-fair)."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://silkroadspices.ca/products/scarborough-fair).</a> I also sopped up the oil that rose to the top with a paper towel, sprinkled the top with parmesan (maybe overkill, but if tons of cheese is wrong, I don&#39;t want to be right), and then broiled for a few moments before letting it sit."

<ol><li>I skipped the butter the second time, instead bringing the milk to a simmer and adding the flour to thicken it. When I used the butter, I got quite a bit of excess grease sitting in the corners of the pan. I know butter is a key component of a béchamel sauce, which is the base of this dish, but you&#39;re adding enough cheese that you don&#39;t need the richness butter provides, and if it cooks out and forms a layer of grease it&#39;s not adding to the recipe anyway.</li><li>1/8 tsp of black pepper is an insultingly small amount for a recipe this large. If you use that little pepper in your cooking, please never invite me to dinner. I know the recipe says &#34;additional pepper optional,&#34; but it really isn&#39;t. This recipe makes 8 servings. 1/64th of a teaspoon per serving might as well be nothing.</li></ol>"

First, it is yet anoth recipe for a family of six; I&#39;m retired and ofteen cook for myself alone (my wife prefers other things).  So, down to one really big Russet potato put through the mandolin at an eighth-inch setting, then cut into smaller pieces.  Second, the sauce as described (and then scale down) is too thick; I found myself addding more ½&amp;½ (more cream flavor, and not so fatty as heavy cream).  Third, cheddar is nice, but I also threw in some store-bought 4-cheese pizza cheese.  I also used some on top during the uncovered baking time -- nice lightly browned top.  Fourth, Imade this a one-dish meal: a layer of sauce, a layer of potato + a bit more sauce and a layer of sliced baked ham + a bit more sauce, another layer of potatoes and the rest of the sauce.  The baking instructions (adjusted a bit for a convection oven) were spot on; the covered cooking time; I added the extra chees on top, then did the uncovered baking time (again, adjusted downward for a convection oven).  A quick (and gentle) stire after a short time sitting just after coming out, brought the sauce together neatly and the result was very satisfactory."

To get it right,  you must cook the dish at lower temperature for a longer duration.

The cheese bechamel is still holding and the potatoes are cooked as far as I can tell using a toothpick to test the softness. Feel free to add your own touches to make this dish your own.

I believe the recipe could be more clearly written that after you cook covered for 1 hour, you THEN remove the cover and cook for an ADDITIONAL 30-40 minutes.  That is plenty of time-- the potatoes were quite soft.  You DEFINITELY do NOT need to precook the potatoes first.  That is a waste of every working person&#39;s limited time.
