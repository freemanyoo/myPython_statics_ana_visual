I anticipated this as taking a lot of time, however, with all components being cooked in the same pan.  Once I got the chicken to about 120°, I transfered the breasts to a oven safe glass baking dish to finish.  That allowed me to time getting the chicken to temp and for it to rest while the bacon and then the onion/brown sugar components were completed.  Timing is everything in cooking and this allowed it all to come together nicely."

I used a smidge of Smart Balance/Amish butter instead of Canola over chicken thighs. I didn&#39;t have Lemon Pepper so squeezed fresh lemon (after rolling it to release the juices) on both sides after browning. Then crisped the thick cut bacon. This is actually easier if you use scissors and cut the bacon in 1-2&#34; pc., cooks quicker also...In a separate cast iron pan, I carmelized 3 small onions in butter and spooned some of the bacon greases into it as needed. Fresh Sharp White Cheddar worked for me as well.I chopped Romaine/Buttercrunch lettuces and rough cut a few Craizines (cranberry raisins) w/coarse pepper, alternating the various delectable pieces with lettuce was almost like Wilted lettuce but better!Brava! I am seriously impressed."

Everyone enjoyed it and cleaned their plate. I will say your chicken breasts won&#39;t cook in 7 minutes on each side. I flattened mine for more even cooking but they still took 30 minutes or more. When I figured they were taking a long time, I cooked the bacon separately, otherwise dinner would have been really late. Once the chicken was done I put some bacon grease in the chicken pan and cooked the onions. I added a bit of chicken broth to the pan to deglaze and I had a bit of a really nice gravy that was totally unexpected.I also worried that cooking everything in the order that the chicken would get cold. I agree the steps should be reversed. Cook the bacon, then onions, then chicken and I suggest adding the onions back to the pan with the chicken to warm them before serving. That way, everything is hot and the cheese will melt. This will definitely be made again in our house!"

The only thing I will do differently next time is put the cheese on top of the chicken, then the onions and bacon on top of the cheese so everything sticks together better.

I made it in 30 minutes flat by cutting the chicken breasts thin and cooking the bacon in the microwave.  Served it over rice with a side of green beans and pillsbury biscuits...tasted great and looked good too.

Next time, I&#39;ll cut the sugar by at least half, and possibly add some pepper flakes or use pepper jack cheese to heat it up a little.  We grilled the chicken and added the toppings afterwards."

I&#39;ve changed up the lemon-pepper with a cayenne based seasoning we love, and I don&#39;t do onions because I don&#39;t care for them.  To cut time, I use ready-to-eat bacon that I heat up in the microwave.  This is great with a veggie blend and rice!  It&#39;s one of our favorites!"

My youngest son said this one is a keeper.  Very easy to make.  My husband loved the onions (I didn&#39;t make enough).  Can&#39;t wait to make it again. Thanks BrendaVikki1413

Since it was such a big hit with my Dad, I decided to bring some to my Grandma (who is very critical of food) and she loved it too. She said it reminded her of something she&#39;d order at Outback Steakhouse. I&#39;ll be making this meal again for sure!"

I don&#39;t usually flatten the chicken breasts.  It takes me about 45 minutes to prepare.  I usually use about half of the bacon.

It took 45 minutes for my onions to carmelize, so the 30 minute total is rather misleading.  I left the cheese out and it was fabulous!"

I also modified the recipe by cubing the chicken and breaking the bacon into bite size pieces. This makes it easier for younger children to enjoy too.
