I’ve been making it for probability 10 years now. I’ll use ground beef often when that is what I have on hand , with beef or chicken stock and it always turns out great. I typically use 2 lbs of ground because my family prefers meatier chilis , soups and sauces."

You didn&#39;t technically make the recipe so don&#39;t rate it.   That being said this chili/soup is awesome just as it is.   I make it multiple times throughout the fall and winter.  I freese it in single.swvings in ziplocks and have a ready to heat and eat lunch.  The pumpkin gives it a richness without tasting pumpkiny.   Just the right amount of spice.

She can&#39;t digest chili-powder foods very well, but we have found that when I substitute pumpkin pie spice for most (not all) of the chili powder, and add some brown sugar and a bit of cinnamon I have to make a double batch or we won&#39;t have any leftovers. Also, when I use ground turkey we like the texture more. Great dish!"

I made it on top of the stove instead of in the crock pot and let it simmer for about and hour to blend the flavors.  I had about 3/4 of a can of pumpkin left over from a coffee cake I had made last weekend and it worked out fine.  I used lower sodium chicken broth and black beans and it was still salty enough for us.  I also substituted a can of mild diced tomatoes with chiles for the regular diced tomatoes.  I noticed one reader said that the recipe turned out too soupy.  Try taking the lid off and cooking it on high a little longer in the crick pot or simmering it with the lid off for a few minutes on top of the stove.  My husband and son both rated this a 5.
