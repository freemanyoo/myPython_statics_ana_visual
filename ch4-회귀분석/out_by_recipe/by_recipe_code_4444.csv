Has anyone else had this issue? Should i have have rinsed them off first? I bet it will still be good! I normally use fresh strawberries and have not had this issue

I substitute real heavy whipping cream for a more natural taste, and it holds up nicely.  I also use other fruits sometimes (black cherries with black cherry jello; blueberries with blueberry jello).  This is a dessert best eaten as fresh as possible, as the pretzels will start to get soft after the first day.  I typically bake my crust the day before, but wait until about 4 hours before serving to assemble.  Be sure to completely cool/chill each layer before adding the next.  Let the pretzel crust cool to room temp first!  Chill after adding the cream cheese mix.  And most importantly, let your jello mix cool before adding it to the top, otherwise it will disturb the cream cheese mix and you&#39;ll have very unattractive chunks of white in your red jello.  Also be sure that the pretzel crust is sealed off from the jello, or it will get soggy."

I don&#39;t normally like pretzels but this dessert is phenomenal!! For the most part,  I followed the receipe but I changed a couple things. I made it in a 9&#34;X13&#34; glass dish. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. I did NOT add any extra sugar. I really like the filling so I doubled the cream cheese. Basically,  I make the crust than I mix the jello topping and while it&#39;s in the fridge,  I make the filling.  I folded in the whip cream instead of mixing it all together. That takes about 20 minutes or so. Then, I poured the jello topping on top and put back  in the fridge and it turned out perfect. IF you follow the directions, everything should fit nicely.  However,  since I added the extra cream cheese,  the topping was overflowing. I just poured in what fit and it was perfect!!! Ive read that people using fresh strawberries add extra sugar to them but I didn&#39;t and it doesn&#39;t need any...but that&#39;s up to you. As for the extra jello that wouldn&#39;t fit, I just put it in a seperate bowl,  and after it was set up, added some whipped cream and had that as an extra dessert!!! Everyone loves this dessert...I will make it for everything!!"

I bought all of the ingredients as written, but did end up with 2 1/2 cups of coarsely crushed pretzels as I did not want to toss them. It still worked fine and amply covered the bottom of the dish. The crème cheese layer worked best by beating the crème cheese and sugar and then folding in the whip topping, as another reviewer recommended. I was skeptical about the jello layer but followed instructions exactly and it worked fine. I put in fridge after first layer for about 30 minutes. Second layer a bit longer and def spread to edges, as another reviewer wisely recommended. Jello layer chilled for a few hours. Sliced beautifully. Looked pretty on a plate. Did not top with additional whip cream, and honestly it did not need any extra sugar, so that would have mainly been for plating. This is where I have to say, it was way too sweet. no way around it either but I may remove the syrup filled strawberries with fresh. The other steps could perhaps be reduced in sugar, but not eliminated as the sugar serves more than one purpose. SO, aside from being overly sweet, this would be a very nice desert. I would never name this a salad or serve WITH a meal though."

The recipe says to boil water then dissolve the jello in a bowl. That doesn&#39;t cook it any further and the bowl actually brings the temperature down. Did you dissolve it in the pot while still simmering/boiling? I wouldn&#39;t even boil the water. Just get it hot enough to dissolve the jello. Hope this helps and is in time for you to try again.

It has always turned out wonderful, receives great reviews and many requests for the recipe! I prefer a coarser chop on the pretzels (rather than totally crushed and use 2 2/3 c because of this). Do let it cool completely. Cream the softened cream cheese and sugar we&#39;ll before folding in the whipped topping. This makes it easier to spread. Be sure to seal all of the edges to the side of the pan and the partially set jello/strawberry mix will not soak into the other layers. Yummy!"

I found it interesting that it only called for the boiling water to make the jello but it worked. The Jello box calls for two cups boiling and two cups ice cold water. My guess is person who commented they had too much jello followed recipe on Jello box and not this recipe. I sliced up frozen strawberries as I didn’t have pre-sliced and added them when not completely thawed to act as substitute for cold water and it worked. The jello doesn’t look as pretty as picture but that may be because I let it sit too long to gel in freezer.

The consistency was also nothing like the above photo. You HAVE to let the pretzel mixture cool COMPLETELY before adding the filling or the whipped cream just melts and there’s no texture. I would even recommend putting it in the fridge to get super cold before putting the filling on it. I had a headache after eating this because of the sugar, so, like i said before, skip the sugar!!!"

Seemed to take quite awhile (at least 2 hours) for the gelatin layer to partially set. Then again, maybe it set too much because it seemed to slide off the cream cheese layer once it was cut.

To avoid issues that some people had you MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO KITCHEN TIPS LISTED &amp; DETAILS1)  Cool crust COMPLETELY.( I CHILL THE CRUST after it has cooled a bit on counter) Be sure to spread the cream cheese layer ALL THE WAY TO OUTER EDGES, so that it is touching the edges of the pan.(then chill)..This avoids letting the jello topping  seep down into the crust DO NOT cut the amount of sugar IN THE CRUST.PART of recipe.It is needed to make it crispy.To speed up the jello portion I dissolve the sugar ( 1/2 C. to 2/3 Cup  NOT 1 full cup) into ONLY 1 CUP BOILING WATER....Then when sugar is FULLY DISSOLVED I add in the remaining  1 Cup VERY COLD water ( OR  COLD juice) drained off from thawed strawberries to equal1 cup ) Be very sure the jello is partially set before spooning evenly over CHILLED cream cheese  layerYou do not want the jello fully set BUT you DO NOT  want it to be a pourable liquid either. IF  the jello fully sets before you get to it...just warm SLIGHTLY for a FEW SECONDS AT A TIME in the microwave till it is SEMI SET. BT not warm. Sometimes I grate some dark chocolate over the whipped cream garnish dallops, before adding the pretzel garnish....If I remember to pick up some chocolate  covered pretzels for the garnish,Good recipe but the directions could include more specific details and the sugar in the jello could be cut down to 2/3 cup....maybe even 1/2 C. especially if the frozen strawberries are sweetened type.."

The only reason why I gave 3 stars was trying to cut through the sliced strawberries was a problem. Maybe next time I&#39;ll cut the berries in slivers. Will try again.

My family prefers this made with raspberries.  I add some fresh berries along with the frozen and also use unsweetened berries.  Doing it this way, we never have a runny gelatin problem or have the dessert separate."

I think next time, I&#39;ll skip the gelatin and use a cooked concoction of berries and cornstarch.  And yes, the 9x13 dish is too large in my opinion."

I always make this when I go to pot-luck dinners. Unfortunately for me I take home an empty pan; no left overs.I have one problem with it. Whenever I make it, and I follow the directions exactly, the jello always slides off the filling on people&#39;s plates. What can I do so it stays together on someone&#39;s plate? It doesn&#39;t bother me but it has bothered those around me."
