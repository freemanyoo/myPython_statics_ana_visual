The flavor is excellent - I only used Dutch processed cocoa, but sometimes it collapses in the middle and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  So . . .  I now make it in a bundt pan and it&#39;s 100% successful.  Whip the cream before making the frosting, but I usually just make a cream cheese frosting and whip it up well.  I often add a heaping tablespoon of espresso powder to the cake batter as well.  I love this cake - dense, smooth, and rich tasting."

I baked this cake for my niece&#39;s 21st Birthday and the cake is delicious and the topping is fantastic! Everyone loved the cake. Easy to make and came out exactly like the picture. Will definitely make again. One thing the frosting was runny so I placed it in the freezer for about 30 minutes...while the cake baked. Once the cake cooled off I added the frosting. It was delish!

The cake sunk in the middle and had a crusty looking lighter color brown in the middle. I usually use a hand mixer on a low setting but this recipe said &#34;combine&#34; therefore I used a whisk until all was combined.   I needed this for our Easter dinner. Now I need to go to the supermarket to buy a cake. I will cut it in pieces later to see if it tastes any good. I  can&#39;t serve it as is. I am not too sure if I should even bother making the icing. This turned out to be an expensive cake re: the guinness beer that no one will drink.

It is a moist cake but doesn&#39;t taste chocolatey at all. It tastes like beer.  The frosting was quite runny so I added additional powdered sugar trying to thicken it up some but it didn&#39;t work. It stayed runny even after refrigerating. It tasted good though. I poured it over the cake. My husband liked it but he loves beer.

I took the recommendation and cut the baking soda to 1 1/4 tsp. Cupcakes took about 12 minutes to cook.  The icing is more of a challenge. I made it as directed and it was thin and soupy and just didn&#39;t seem right. I read another comment that said they mixed the heavy cream alone until it was stiff and folded it into the mixed cream cheese and powdered sugar. I would highly recommend using this method.  I also added about a tablespoon of bailey&#39;s into the cream cheese and powdered sugar and it tasted great. I would recommend this recipe.

(but still actually tasted great!)  Saw lots of other people having the same issue.  Cut back on the Baking Soda!  2nd time I only used 1-1/4tsp and it rose perfectly!   And Don&#39;t use the wisk when adding in flour and baking soda.  use a spoon and stir just until everything is all wet.I also like to give a bit of spice to my Cream Cheese frosting, add in some good cinnamon and ground ginger to give it a bit of extra kick.

It can also be make using water.  I know the beer will give the cake a malty flavor but the water or soda will work too.

Just has a hint of malt flavor from the Guinness.  This cake is going to be a new addition to our yearly March menu for sure.  Twelve servings makes for a very large piece of very rich cake - I think you could get at least 18 servings.  I&#39;ve also seen this cake with a peanut butter cream cheese frosting - and that sounds yummy.
