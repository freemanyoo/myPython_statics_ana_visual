We changed it slightly by replacing the marinating step with putting it in a crockpot on low for 8 hours.  Then we threw the chicken on a hot grille for just a couple of minutes per side. The chicken fell right off of the bone and because the chicken cooked in the marinade, we were able to use it over rice which was heavenly. Thanks for the recipe."

Thighs were tender and a big hit with the family. Word of warning if cooking on a bbq. Be prepared for a lot of cleaning. I soaked grills overnight and the used oven cleaner. Our gerni high pressure cleaner still could not remove the vharred marinate. The brown sugar hardens like cement and i ended up using a hammer and screwdriver to try and get it to let go. Next time i will use a disposable foil grill on top of the bbq burners.
