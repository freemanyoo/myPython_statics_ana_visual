They are quick, easy and never fail.  I will advise measuring the interior of your pan.  I have two pans sold as 15x10.  One measures 15x10 on the interior and one measures 15x10 on the exterior which makes it smaller.  I like to use my (larger) 15x10 pan and increase the butter and sugar to 1 cup each."

I recieved requests for the recipe.  I used an extra 1/2 cup of marshmallows, but other than that, I did not alter the ingredients.  However, if you truly use a pan with an interior measurement of 15 x 10, you will need a couple of extra graham crackers (trim with a knife) to fill the small gap at the bottom of pan.  Fill the pan so the graham crackers don&#39;t shift around during baking. As another reviewer suggested, make sure there is an overhang of foil on the short ends for removal from pan, spray the foil with nonstick spray, and do not overcook the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture (only a minute after the butter is melted and sugar is incorporated into the butter).  Watch the baking time carefully after the 12 minute mark.  At 12 minutes, mine had browned only at the edges and not in the middle.  Try to get to an overall golden brown without letting the outside edges get too overdone.  I let it cool for about 15 min and then removed it from the pan by holding the 2 ends of the foil.  I let it cool completely and then cut as directed with a sharp knife.  The pizza cutter idea didn&#39;t work well for me.  I will absolutely make this again."

First and foremost, if you follow my recommendations, you will not have any problems at all, despite what others say here.  What I did is use Reynolds (brand) Release Foil (make sure dull side is facing up) in the 10X15X1 pan.  MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH FOIL HANGING OVER THE SHORT ENDS TO LIFT THE COOKIES OUT OF THE PAN LATER.  I ALSO sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray very lightly.  I made sure all of the graham crackers fit properly in the pan (trim using a paring knife if need be--it&#39;s much easier than you think).  Once the crackers are in the pan properly, I did use more than two cups of mini marshmallows...probably 2-1/2 cups total--enough to cover all of the crackers sufficiently.  Then what I did is I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of light brown (not dark brown) sugar.  Make sure you use real butter and fresh brown sugar.  I cooked it precisely 1 minute after the butter melted.  I think what a lot of cooks are doing is cooking the butter and brown sugar mixture too long.  This will cause the cookies to not turn out like they are supposed to (I know from experience).  I used 1-1/2 teaspoons of GOOD cinnamon (like Penzey&#39;s Celyon) and good, double strength vanilla extract.  I also put a PINCH (no more) of salt in the caramel mixture.  When it is cooked, I transferred the entire caramel mixture into a Pyrex measuring cup and poured it very carefully over the marshmallows so nothing puddled.  Then I topped with the coconut and almonds and baked for 12 minutes and then checked it.  My oven tends to be a bit psychotic, so it only takes about one minute more in mine to brown.  When you take the cookies out of the oven, you will see that the marshmallows look like they are not cooked all the way.  Don&#39;t worry.  They will finish melting when you take them out of the oven.  Remove pan from oven and place on a towel on table or counter for five minutes.  Then lift cookies out by short ends with the foil overhang and place back on table or counter for five minutes or so (depends on temperature in your house at the time).  Then lightly spray a large pizza cutter with nonstick spray and use the pizza cutter to slice through the cookies--don&#39;t remove from pan right away--just slice.  Then let cool completely and put in a very loosely covered container.  They won&#39;t last long enough to go stale.  Not to worry.  People are having problems with these cookies because, I think, they are cooking the caramel way too long.  Even a minute too long is tooo long.  I hope this helps you guys so that you will try it--even try it again, if you didn&#39;t like the way they turned out the first time.  Happy baking!"

I may add more coconut too.  Thank you for the recipe."
