I only used one bar of cream cheese and increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup.  I did have to bake a little longer than 1 hour. So delicious!!!  I will definitely make again.

I also chose to beat the cream cheese with the liquid before adding as opposed to doing the cubes, and I added both a little sugar and pure real vanilla. However I agree with some other remarks that it was too eggy.  I could taste the egg more than the other ingredients and the texture was very dense.  Instead of 6 eggs (again I halved) next time I would do 4 but keep everything else the same.  Sauce is good but very sweet, a little goes a long way.  I will definitely make it again, just change the eggs to help the texture be more like french toast than an egg casserole.  I&#39;d give it higher stars if it wasn&#39;t for the eggs."

I used 1 loaf of Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon Bread and I purposely just used the whole loaf, crusts and all the 2nd time around! I used just 1 package of cream cheese and the 2nd time around, I beat the  8-oz. package of cream cheese with 2/3 cup sugar 5 minutes, then I added 6 eggs and 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract.  I scraped the bottom and sides of bowl and then I added 2 cups of milk.  I used 1 PINT of blueberries for both the casserole and for the blueberry sauce.  For the sauce, I&#39;d added 2 Tbsp. bottled lemon juice and I stirred the sugar and cornstarch together before adding the water, then cooked the 3 minutes until it came to a boil.  I stirred in the blueberries, lowered the heat and cooked 10 minutes or untilthe berries burst. After removing from the heat, I stirred in 1 Tbsp. butter. I think that creaming the sugar with the cream cheese makes this dish more flavorful than just cubing it! I&#39;d spritzed the 13x9x2&#34; baking pan with PAM, used a paper towel to spread the spray around and I&#39;d placed the bread cubes in the prepared pan.  Then I added the berries and poured the milk/egg mixture over the bread cubes and berries.  I did allow the French toast to sit, covered, 8 hours on the 2nd time around and then cut vents in the foil to allow the steam to escape!  I also did allow the dish to sit, covered, 1/2 hour before baking, then I baked, covered, 30 minutes at 350o F. and then uncovered the dish and baked 30 minutes more.  For an added touch, I sprinkled 4 tsp. cinnamon-sugar over top on the 2nd time around!  I think that my 2nd time worked much better-the first time, I felt that I could improve this recipe! Using sugar is better for me than using honey or maple syrup!My first time around, I&#39;d used about 9 Tbsp. maple syrup all together and I&#39;d used 2 cups of milk!  I still stuck to 6 eggs, though and the 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract. The first time around I HAD cubed the 8-oz. package of cream cheese and topped with the remaining bread cubes and blueberries!The sauce is GREAT!   I&#39;m finding that what may work for the original recipe with 1 person-for me, it helped to make these additional improvements to have a dish proudly served!delowenstein"

First of all it was to &#39;Eggy&#34; for me. So I&#39;d strongly suggest that you NOT use a dozen of eggs that this calls for! That&#39;s just WAY to much egg. The ladys at Church liked it but I can&#39;t believe this is a Grand prize winner. I won&#39;t be making this again. I was so disappointed! One lady at Church had to actually spit it out of her mouth. She said sorry but there&#39;s way to many textures going on with this. I did really like the homemade blueberry syrup however. I would rank the Syrup Only a 5 but not the casserole. I find it surprising that So many of ya&#39;ll like this so well.

It is also a favorite of anyone that tries it.  I have made some minor revisions.  I use one one 8 ounce block of low fat cream cheese and a whole loaf of white bread minus 4 slices ( it makes it more substantial).  I use 2+ cups of blueberries in the casserole ( one is not enough for an 9x13 pan)  I also make a double batch of the syrup but only add 1 total cup of sugar.  This allows a person to really add a nice scoop of syrup.  If you add 2 cups of sugar it is much too sweet.  I have the perfect breakfast treat  !!

They thought it was very good. I had to bake it 10+ minutes longer than the recipe called for and that eliminated the mushy-bread-egg condition that sometimes comes with an overnight egg bake dish. I used Vienna bread and it was fine. My revisions for next time: leave the crusts on (that was time-consuming) and I may layer the top of the bread with thinner slices of cream cheese rather than the 1&#34; cubes. Not everyone around my breakfast table was a big fan of cream cheese chunks. I also thought that I might try using raspberries rather than blueberries to see how that goes. All in all, this was a very nice change from the usual french toast or egg back recipe!"
