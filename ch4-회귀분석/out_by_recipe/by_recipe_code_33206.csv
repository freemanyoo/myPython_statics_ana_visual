I say &#34;was&#34; since it didn&#39;t last the weekend! I split the cake batter into two round 9 inch springform pans and used a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges (all the store had at the time) and it produced a moist cake that was light but paired well with the frosting. I had enough frosting left over (my household prefers a lightly frosted cake) to do a five cup salad variation for dessert as well! Will make this again and again!!

It is my mother in law’s recipe and one of my favorites.  She calls it “Orange Pineapple Sunshine Cake” and one of my good friends calls it “Pig Lickin’ Good Cake”.  It is so good and very easy to make.  Also you can keep the ingredients on hand for a quick dessert to take to a potluck or just for company!

He explained that it&#39;s called a Pig Pickin&#39; Cake because it was the traditional dish brought to a pig picking in his neck of North Carolina- a pig picking being a &#34;neighborhood&#34; event that follows a pig roasting: After the pig is roasted, the women get together to pick and shred the meat from the carcass, for the making of traditional Carolina BBQ. Our family&#39;s version includes a golden butter cake mix (box), 1/2c oil, the fruit from acan of mandarins and 4T of the juice, and 3 whole eggs. The frosting is 20can of crushed pineapple- not drained- with 1 box instant vanilla pudding mixed in. After about 5 mins, fold the whipped topping (12oz)  into the pudding/pineapple. I have made this as a sheet cake, 2 layer cake, cupcakes, or in a springform cut into 3 layers. Always delicious, and one of my very favorite desserts! Thanks Uncle Wally, miss you!"

If you&#39;re super health conscious, you can certainly make it according to this recipe, but we like it a tiny bit more indulgent in my house. We use the whole eggs (indicated on the cake mix), canola oil instead of applesauce for the cake itself, and regular pudding mix and whipped topping for the frosting. We also add coconut and orange extract to the frosting mixture. It&#39;s delicious and a hit every time!"

First of all let me say that the cake baked up fabulously.  In fact I followed the cake recipe only changing to a gluten free cake mix.  I did make the frosting with a 12 oz. size whipped cream.  I had some left over and and figured why not.  This cake was so moist and delicious.  Even better the second day.  If you need to eat gluten free go ahead and make this cake.  I know I will make this cake again and again.  Next time I think I will put some maraschino cherries on top."

The juice and pineapple provide the liquid, and when the whipped topping is added it makes a creamy topping with enough stability to spread. If you prepare the pudding according top package directions, it will be much too runny.It doesn&#39;t include &#34;prepare according to directions&#34; because that is not what is to be done.  It states &#34;pudding mix&#34; instead, so it should be added dry.  Try it! It is a great easy top layer for the cake!"
