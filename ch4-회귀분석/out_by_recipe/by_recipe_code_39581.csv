I made them with Natural Peanut Butter, Truvia Powdered Sugar, and Sugar free chocolate. They tasted just like a regular peanut butter cup. They are very rich, so the smaller size worked very well. I got 33 cups and 2 just peanut butter filling because I ran out of chocolate, but that was plenty. Will definitely make these again."

I double the peanut butter mixture and use regular cupcake paper and put a layer of chocolate down, then a nice size dollop of the peanut butter mixture, then more chocolate. Make sure the peanut butter doesn’t go to the sides. Otherwise, the chocolate won’t seal around it all the way. Put them in the fridge until cooled. Then take scissors and cut the remaining paper above the chocolate off. This will make the original size peanut butter cups. These are so much better then the store bought ones and well worth the work!!"

I found the recipe years ago but I don&#39;t care for peanut butter.  So I simply use marshmallow cream and whip it up in the mixer and then continue with the recipe replacing the peanut butter with the marshmallow cream.   These make great mallow cups.  I keep the recipes ingredients around for when I get the taste for some chocolate.  I make them in a regular cupcake pan and then wrap and take them to church for others so I don&#39;t pig out on them

So much easier to make and you lessen the risk of not using the chocolate in time for it going all dry and lumpy.I  bought candy/sweet clear bags.  I tripled the amount of mixture.   I used a non stick reusable sheet and lined an oven tray it covered almost half the tray the layers.   I used galaxy bars, no cheap chocolate chips.  So  much smoother a taste for the chocolate really adds to the taste from what i&#39;ve been told and I added Himalayan pink salt to the  mixture of peanut butter.Microwaves are bad for you so i didn&#39;t use one , i don&#39;t have one,  it changes the cellular structure of food and is harmful to dna.  i just used a stainless steel pot  on the cooker, filled with water on 3 and a smaller one on there for the chocolate mix and the the peanut butter mix.I did first layer put in freezer for 20 mins then did the peanut layer, easier to spread it when bottom layer is hard,  same in freezer 20 mins then last layer of chocolate back in the freezer for 20 mins.  Then using a cleaver, I cut it into big bars looks perfect and great.I got 3 pounds 8 ounces worth of bars and 10 big bars out of it.  Much much easier to make these than to try make perfect cups.  Anyone i&#39;ve made these for prior, absolutely lovesssssss the taste.So going  to wrap in greaseproof paper, then in yellow tissue paper inside the bag, then put into the clear bags, tie on yellow ribbons and glue a chick and an egg on ribbon and hand out  for Easter  :)Would be great fora photo upload function."

My family loves them just as much as Reeses&#39;. I no longer take the time to make individual cups. I spread half the chocolate mixture in a bar pan lined with wax paper sling. Chill the bar pan until the chocolate is set enough to spread on the peanut butter mixture. Spread on the remaining chocolate (it may have to be reheated). Then cut into pieces.

Before he became allergic he ENJOYED peanut butter cups.  Hasn&#39;t had one in 6 years.  So for Valentine&#39;s Day I decided to substitute soy butter for the peanut butter in this recipe and it turned out AWESOME!!!  You really can&#39;t tell the difference and he got to enjoy a long lost treat.  I did prepare the soy butter filling ahead but only added an extra 1/2c conf. sugar because the soy butter is a little dryer than peanut butter and didn&#39;t want filling to crumble.  Think next time I will add some crushed up pretzels to this and enjoy 3 great tastes together :-)  Excellent alternative for people allergic to peanuts!!!

I used a teaspoon melon baller to scoop heaping spoon of melted chocolate into cups then a slightly smaller one for peanut butter then back to larger one for top chocolate. Also put your cups on a tray covered in foil or pretty paper then you can refrigerate and serve on same tray. I don&#39;t think it was messy at all and when I melted chocolate and peanut butter I put pb on bottom glass dish then Choc. Melted about 45 secs stirred then another 45 secs. Wonderful and Very Easy!

I had no trouble melting the chocolate mixture in the microwave.  I used half power and checked (and stirred!)every 30 - 45 seconds~~no problem.  I did increase the powdered sugar to 1 cup and rolled the mixture out into 3 logs each 9 inches and them scored them every 3/4 inch and refrigerated them until firm. Then followed the directions for putting them together in the recipe putting the little &#34;chucks&#34; of peanut butter mixture in each cup instead of having to spoon it in.  I was really impressed that this recipe worked out perfectly with the quantities given and made the 36 cups exactly.  I&#39;ll use it again.

Not dry like the store bought kind that are made months in advance.  I keep these in the refrigerator until ready to serve because they do tend to get a little soft at room temperature.  You can use papers and sprinkles to fit the occassion or holiday.
