I used cherry tomatoes as that’s what the garden is overflowing with!  I can only hope cooks reach a point of reading a recipe and assessing if the types of seasonings or quantity of seasonings suits their tastes. And then decide how or if you wish to make said recipe. We enjoyed this with additional fresh ground black pepper. Thank you

Maybe it is because I too am from Indiana.  maybe because both sides of my family in a weird way are Wrights! Maybe that is why I liked it. Too I miss my grandparents and my mom. Probably the taste buds in the mid-west are far different than other regions. If you&#39;re concerned about soybean oil then I know there are other mayo&#39;s you buy. Or make your mayo from scratch. I find it unfair that someone would call this a loser or anyone&#39;s recipe a loser. Just simply state that if it was not for your taste buds instead of insulting someone&#39;s recipe. That might have hurt their feelings. I frankly thought when I saw that...I will not dare share any of my families recipes because of how insulting people can be. In this day."

I also use the spices to taste  -  that&#39;s not nearly enough salt and pepper.  My mom always added a dash of nutmeg to her potato salad and I do too.  It adds just a little different flavor but don&#39;t use too much - just a dash or two (maybe equals about 1/8 tsp or so).  I know a dash is different for everyone!  If I&#39;m feeling lazy or don&#39;t have a lot of time, I sometimes add the pre-cooked bacon bits.  This is very similar to the kind we grew up with."

With a pound of bacon, I served it as a main dish, and it served four with no seconds.  We do have big appetites though.  I added a little Kraft Zesty Italian right before serving because it seemed a little dry."

I then &#34;doctored&#34; it up with more salt and some Cajun seasoning and only then did the salad have &#34;presence&#34; enough for my family&#39;s tastes.  I will keep this in my Recipe Box with notes added for the above alterations.

Everyone loves it. I usually use MiracleWhip (which is lower fat than real mayo) and it tastes delicious. I also mix in about 2 T or so of the bacon grease to the salad for more bacon flavor (bacon junkies here!).  Great recipe!

I initially got it from the taste of home magazine. Everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe and I never have left overs. My husband actually asks me to make batch for the house and the bbq so he can have some when he wants a snack later because he knows it will be gone before we get home. I have even have people complain that I did not make enough because it is gone before they can even dish their plate at the bbqs. It is a keeper!!!!!!!!! I did not put celery in it or the pepper. I also let the bacon and veggies sit in sauce for five ten minutes before I pour over the noodles and I think it makes for better flavor."
