It was a little milder than l really like.  I added 4 slices of chopped bacon and some symbol.  I&#39;m sure the leftovers will be wonderful.

Our friends had it the 2nd time and they said it was so good and they wanted the recipe. My butter, flour and mixture was thick before boiling, so I didn’t boil it either time."

I prefer to mix the cheddar with the sauce and melt it that way. As others have said, adding extra milk isn&#39;t a bad idea. Also, I divide this recipe in half because I&#39;m only cooking for two people.  I stumbled across another recipe which is very similar to this one. It is seasoned with 1/4 teaspoon onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder.  My husband likes it this way, because he does not care for bland food. Also, we use sharp cheddar, or, as we call it in Canada, &#34;old&#34; or even &#34;extra old&#34; cheddar."

Good God I could have built a chimney.  However, I was able to rescue this.  I had used half-and-half instead of 2%, and ended up having to add an ADDITIONAL 2 cups of 1% milk.  I doubled the spices as well.  With some TLC, it came out irresistible.  I cooked 24 ounces (two boxes) of the Prince Thick and Hearty elbows.  For topping, I melted 2 T. butter and added 1/2 cup panko and tossed to mix.  Sprinkled it on top then sprinkled an additional 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar.  Convection baked at 325 degrees for 9 minutes in my counter oven.  All family gave it 4 1/2 stars!  Some recipes I have call for a little nutmeg in the sauce and others have called for a little dijon mustard.  Both are good."

I added a 1/2 cup of half and half to the cheese sauce and that gave it just the right consistency. I gently stirred the cheddar into the finished sauce off heat until melted, instead of tossing it with the pasta, and that worked out fine. I found it was easier to mix the sauce and the pasta together in a large bowl before transferring to baking dish (11x13 pan worked fine). I also sprinkled a liberal helping of shredded cheddar cheese over the top prior to baking."

You can really half the sauce to the same amount of pasta OR you can add in some extras like broccoli or ham etc. I sometimes like the extra sauce so I will make an extra cup of macaroni to the regular sauce.

The last couple of times, I mixed up the ingredients according to the recipe and then dumped it all into a buttered crock pot. It turned out perfectly then, too! This is the all time best mac-n-cheese recipe. For the american process cheese, instead of Velveeta, I use Kraft Deluxe American slices or I buy sliced American cheese at the deli counter, then cut it into chunks. For the shredded cheddar, I buy block cheddar and shred it myself. I usually use either all sharp cheddar or half sharp and half medium/mild. The sharp cheddar is the one with all the cheesy flavor.

The family devoured this casserole. Then I lost the recipe and couldnt find it until yesterday, they devoured it again! Some changes did have to be made.1. I used a whole box of bow ties and needed a little bit more, it was very saucy.  I like it like that so it didnt bother me.2. Yes, the sauce does get a little too thick, i just slowly added chicken broth to get to a good consistency for us.3.  GRATE your own cheese! It makes a world of difference in that grainy taste, plus its cheaper.I can finally stop looking for a mac and cheese recipe, this will be the only one i ever make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!"

Nice &amp; creamy.  Thick &amp; rich.  Great dish.  Will definitely make again.  Although I question it serving 6.  Mine made a 9 by 13 baking dish &amp; when used as a side would easily feed 8.  Maybe 6 if it were the entree.
