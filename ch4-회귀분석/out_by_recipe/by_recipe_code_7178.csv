I followed the recipe exactly, and the cupcakes and frosting were scrumptious! The only thing I would do differently would be to start checking them after 15-18 minutes, as they weren’t quite as moist as I would have liked when I removed them from the oven after 20 minutes. But I am definitely adding this to my list of favorite recipes!"

Carolee followed the recipe exactly except she used yellow squash (instead of zucchini) and used 1 3/4 cups grated (instead of 1 1/2 cups) ...  she also put toasted walnuts on top of some.I made them a bit differently.  I used vegetable oil (instead of canola), I used 2 cups of grated zucchini (instead of 1 1/2 cups) and I put the batter in a greased and floured 9X13 cake pan.....  baked at 350 degrees F.  for 25-30 minutes.  I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing and, after icing the cake,  topped it with 2/3 cup chopped and toasted walnuts.Both versions were extremely tasty!!  The cake is moist and not too sweet, like some zucchini cakes ......  the icing tops off the cake perfectly.

I like that the consistency is cake like rather than like many other  recipes which are heavier and taste more like a muffin. The icing tops this off beautifully and takes it up a notch for sure.  I peel my zucchini as is our preference. People that dislike zucchini would not even know zucchini is in this when peel is not present as it just imparts a moisture to the cupcake .Raisins or pecans would be a great addition to the batter.

I had no problem with the frosting as is, make sure you let it actually get down to lukewarm if you are having problems with the consistency. Setting it in a pan of cool water can speed the process.

I have adjusted this recipe by adding 1 Tbsp. ground Navel orange and I also added 1/2 tsp. each of all-spice andnutmeg to the other spices and dry ingredients listed in this recipe!  I used 1 cup shredded zucchini with 1/2 cup unpeeled chopped tart apple, rather than 1-1/2 cups zucchini. For the icing, I&#39;d used 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar-the 2 cups didn&#39;t make for a good spreading consistency!  I&#39;d also just melted the butter with the brown sugar-I didn&#39;t cube the butter.I used evaporated milk and started with 1/4 cup milk, and gradually added UP TO 2 Tbsp.more milk to achieve a desirable spreading consistency!  I did have to stir the frosting with a mixing spoon to make the icing pliable and easier for me to spread.

Also, I would suggest adding chopped nuts to the batter--walnuts or pecans--maybe a 1/2 cup, depending on your preference.Also, for the frosting, I think you would run into problems adding the melted butter, brown sugar and milk with the confectioners sugar (as a preference, I would subsitute skim milk for the 2%).  I would do the icing a bit differently.  Warm the milk and brown sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolves.  Soften butter slightly in the microwave, then place in a stand mixer and mix until smooth.  Add confectioners sugar and mix.  Add cooled brown sugar/milk mixture to the above and mix until the frosting is combined.   Add additional confectioners sugar to achieve a spreadable consistency for frosting."

Like a spice cake as one review said. They weren&#39;t as moist as I had imagined from the reviews. I think I will make them bigger next time. I don&#39;t believe I made them big enough for the moistness. The carmel frosting is DEFINITELY worth the time and effort it takes to make it. I know I will use it on cakes and other things.

Previously I used my mom&#39;s zucchini recipe and this frosting recipe.  I decided to try this recipe just as it is written and they were incredible.  I did not drain the zucchini either...and there was a lot of liquid too.  This is how good they are...I first made them and accidentally added 1 third cup sugar instead of 1 and a third cup ( my bad handwriting).  My 6 nephews and nieces ran in from outside and grabbed one even though I told them what I did.  They were all gone in less then 5 minutes!!!  I personally didn&#39;t care for them but they still raved about how good they  were.  I then made a second batch...to me it was much better:))</p>
