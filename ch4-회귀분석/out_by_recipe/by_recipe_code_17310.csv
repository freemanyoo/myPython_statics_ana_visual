I read all the reviews before trying this for the first time. I agree with the review about the flour quantity. I cut it to 1/2 cup of flour but still the sauce became like spackle. I had to add an additional 1 1/2 quarts of liquid to make the sauce creamy. Next time I will try just an Alfredo sauce with butter, Parmesan and cream and maybe some white wine. 
Also, I added Old Bay to the seafood liquid, and subbed shallots and garlic for the green onion. 
Overall it was delicious."

Surely this must be an error? I ended up adding some extra milk, cream, chicken stock just trying to make it a little more smooth. It is extremely bland as well. I added some garlic but would suggest adding some of that old bay others have suggested. I seriously can’t understand how this is award winning or how some people ended up with it being runny. After adjusting the consistency of the “sauce” I was able to create a lasagna. I added a little mozzarella to the top. My youngest son thought it was good but not great. Probably best for those who prefer a bit of a bland palate."

It is a very tasty dish but a little bit of Old Bay added a great deal to the flavor.  A little dash of lime enhanced it as welland next time I will add some garlic. It just seemed to be missing something in its purist form.   Be prepared because this recipe makes a lot of lasagna and it is very fattening and high in cholesterol.  I cut it in half and still had a lot of leftovers.  Also, I think you would be hard pressed to prepare this in 35 minutes.  Plan on at least an hour.  Lastly, get your credit card or checkbook out because it is not an inexpensive meal to make.  Once a year on special occasions or if we are having company and want to impress.

B/c of the changes I was able to make TWO lasagnas and I used the NO BOIL Lasagna! WIn-Win!!!I added a ricotta mix to make this dish like a lasagna. To my ricotta I like to add chili powder, egg, garlic powder, salt, fresh cilantro, and black pepper.  I think the chili powder help to bring out the flavor to the whole dish b/c it is a creamy dish.I did add fresh chopped garlic  when I cooked the green onions - BUT I also added and cooked 1 diced white onion tooI doubled the creamy mix b/c  I used the no boil lasagna noodles and I felt the ratio of the seafood: shrimp (cut into 3 pieces if using large shrimp (1lb), scallops (1lb), and claw crab meat (1lb) would have needed the extra sauceI did not expect to make 2, but I did.  One dish had 4 noodle layers and my other dish just had 3 noodle layers.I did noodle, ricotta, mozzarella and parmesean cheese layer, followed by seafood sauce. Then repeat the layers.  Be sure to reserve just a cup of sauce (without the seafood) for the top last layer of the lasagna. I did top that with Mozzarella too.  I didn&#39;t reserve sauce for my 2nd dish top noodle, so it was covered with the seafood. I didn&#39;t want it to burn, so that one had extra mozzarella cheese on it.Yes this is a heart attack waiting to happen, but if you are going for it, then go for it.  I wouldn&#39;t make this everyday, maybe special occasions.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made it for a potluck.  It is a little time consuming, but oh so good!!! The other dish I gave pieces away.  I only wanted 2 pieces b/c I am health conscious. But no doubt with my changes it was good.I don&#39;t measure, but I used this recipe as a guideline."

I like to add thinly-sliced mushrooms as the crab, scallop, shrimp and cream sauce mixture can become a little rich without the mushrooms to balance it out.

I expected this dish to be delicious based on the standing 5 star rating, but it was even better than I expected. Could hold it&#39;s own against any seafood lasagna I&#39;ve eaten at restaurants. Agree with other comments - great for Christmas, or special occasion meals, as it is really rich and can be pricy. My recipe adaptations based on seafood avail. in KS: ~2.25 lbs. king crab legs* (not Alaskan), 2 lbs. sea scallops (since they were almost half as expensive as bay, and are more tender. Cut into smaller pieces.), 2lbs frozen wild salad shrimp (Costco).  Using the fresh crab was well worth it, once I was done cracking it all - the flavor was amazing! I added 6-8 roasted garlic cloves to the sauce as well. My entire family loved this lasagna, including kids and some pickier people. I will absolutely make this again! *Actually less expensive per lb. than canned crab. I also doubled the recipe as others and so glad I did. I also used DeLallo Organic Italian Whole Wheat Lasagna (no boil) noodles which are my go to for lasagna."

I used 1.5 pounds of shrimp (12 ounces), 1 pound (16 ounce) of REAL jumbo lump crab meat, and 1.5 pounds of bay scallops (12 ounces).  I doubled everything else.  I also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and I added the garlic just before I added the broth and juices.  I used Costco&#39;s fresh, aged parmigiano reggiano cheese.  My sauce was not bland at all!  It was thick, rich and decadent!  Also, in the doubling process, I used an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and an 8 ounce bottle of lobster juice.  Be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isn&#39;t runny.  Additionally, because mine did not brown after 38 minutes of baking, I put it under the broiler for about 2 minutes.  It was perfect!  While the seafood makes the dish costly, it was well worth it!
