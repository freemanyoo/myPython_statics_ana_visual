I love the almond-cherry flavor combination so liked that the almond extract was in the bars as well as the glaze. I also sprinkled some blanched almonds over the top of the bars after glazing, for extra flavor and texture and it looked really pretty too. These bars were a bit thinner than I prefer, so next time I will bake them in a smaller pan."

I had a 1/2 can of strawberry pie filling to use up so I only made 1/4 of the bar recipe (but used 1/2 the glaze recipe to pipe on top and made it a really thick consistency, topping once they were completely cool).  I made this in an 8x8 baking dish and it came out perfect, although I did allow it to bake for 50 minutes.  Next time I&#39;ll try 1/2 the recipe in a 13x9.  I think the key is to have a thin layer of bar on the bottom and increase the time a bit to assure it&#39;s done.  I didn&#39;t use the almond extract, that seemed odd to me, but will try the almond slivers like others.  I&#39;ll be making these for company in the future, I think they&#39;d be wonderful on a brunch buffet!"

You would think that would be a hint that most don&#39;t care for it.
This July is was a goopy mess. It had to be scooped out of the pan. It was certainly under baked. 
If you like the store bought Kuchens/Danish/Streusel that is baked in the foil tins, then you&#39;ll probably like this because in my opinion that&#39;s exactly what it tastes like."

If you bake them a bit longer than recommended the crust holds up better in bar form.  I often bake them 45-50 mins at home.  Never had a burnt crust.  The convection ovens at the bakery were definitely faster.  If they come out with softer crust just cut into smaller “2-bite” size pieces or eat with fork.  The batter is very thick.  Fist time I made I I though I did something wrong. You can easily alter the amount of sugar to your liking.  Change up the filings, extracts and nuts or other add-in’s as you choose.  It’s pretty forgiving.  It’s kinda bad hard to mess up this recipe. Under-baking is usually the biggest issue, as is not using enough filling.  At a bakery you can’t skimp on fillings.  Customers don’t like that :-).  If you do add the drizzle on top it will make the bars a bit wet it the sit out all day.   Bakery tip: For dryer drizzle use less milk.  It should be very thick - as in “not a drizzle at all” but kinda toothpaste like.  Then heat in microwave, no more than 10 seconds at a time. Gets super hot very fast.  Once hot, drizzle quickly, as it will harden/get crusty very quickly.  Once it drys on the bars it won’t make them overly soft.  Works great and you can remix remaining crusted drizzle (with few drops of liquid) and reheat if it gets too difficult to work with.  I burned myself a few times with the hot mix so be careful not to overheat it"

Next time, I&#39;ll reduce the dough on the bottom and add it to the top. I also baked it for 35 minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for another 5 min with the door cracked.
