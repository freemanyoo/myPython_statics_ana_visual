I believe in trying a recipe as written first and making adjustments later if needed, so that&#39;s what I did. Many have said it&#39;s very thick as written and I have to agree. It tasted great but was overly thick for my liking. The second time around I used a 1/2 cup of flour and for me, that was the perfect amount."

I&#39;ve made it as written several times with homemade crust. It makes enough filling as written for 2 deep dish 9 inch pies, or 3ish normal pie pans. If you do 2 normal pie pans, they will be overflowing and quite saucy. My additions after tasting as written are to add a teaspoon of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary and sage. Easy shortcut if you&#39;re in a hurry is to replace the carrot/peas/carrots with mixed frozen veggies!

So many recipes online these days are fails, but this worked perfectly!  For our family&#39;s preference, I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup.  The recipe still worked just fine with half the butter.  We also prefer a bit more seasoning, so I added a teaspoon of my poultry seasoning and some ground cayenne pepper, and snuck in a handful of julienned kale for a little extra nutrition. I&#39;m sure the seasoning in the recipe would be just fine as is though for most families.  The amount of filling this makes is plentiful - easily enough for two deep dish pie plates, but one could probably even do 3 shallow pie dishes.  I baked one pie and put the other in the freezer for another night.  My family loved this recipe.  Thank you for a reliable recipe that we will use again and again."

I peeled/diced and boiled  2 potatoes, used 2/3 cup frozen corn and 1/2 cup peas and  3/4 cup canned carrots, drained  the ones that needed to have liquid removed , boiled 2 ck breast and shredded them )  the sauce was half of the regular as given  and had great flavor and thickened  well. Had a little extra filling left over so I made  a very small one with just crust on top.       Yummy.                              ***I see that another reviewer said they made the full recipe and froze half  of the filling for another time, good idea also."

I made half a recipe (more or less) in a 10” pie plate with my favorite crust recipe.

No peas since hubs really can’t stand them, so I threw in some leftover green beans instead. And I used a combination of skim milk and half&amp;half, because again, it’s what I had.

I boiled my potatoes/carrots in chicken broth, then used the same broth to boil the cubes chicken meat breast and used the same broth for the gravy.

I used a cup of homemade milk free gravy I had left from the meal for which I made the roast chicken we were using (leftovers) for this pie. I recently discovered, if done right, no milk is needed and creaminess survives! I also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid. In addition I added a Tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes. I made a homemade simple crust (ice water, butter, flour and salt) and brushed the top with yolk/water combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme. The cooking time was spot on, even here at high elevation in Colorado. I only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy, hearty, comforting goodness.

On the 1.5 cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it. This makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast. Next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or Velveeta cheese. Last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic, pressed. Put this in during sauce thickening. I sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting. He is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had. HE would not say that for fun. It&#39;s goooouooood!

The sauce was a stark white, tasteless paste that no amount of &#34;doctoring&#34; after the fact could resolve. A total waste of ingredients and home made pie crust. A much better option is to make your chicken stock ( or use store-bought stock ) and thicken it using 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water and simmer until it thickens before adding the chicken and vegetables. That way you still have chicken gravy not flour gravy."

I know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when I say I haven&#39;t made this exact recipe, but is is very close to one my mother, who was a fabulous cook, taught me years ago. I read a lot of the reviews, because there are so many, and I want to make comments based on what I read and my level of experience.  Because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe I would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments. If you&#39;re not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon - then sample it. Not enough, add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again. If you like that amount you don&#39;t need to add the full teaspoon. Flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients. Spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything. You will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences. AND - it does not mean the recipe is not great. The person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning - based on her family&#39;s taste buds but it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be adjusted to your own! The same goes for any other recipe. Have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go. Personalize to your heart&#39;s content! It really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they don&#39;t know how to make it more palatable. I do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had Home Economics classes in high school - though they didn&#39;t teach me much I hadn&#39;t learned at home. Cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues. Remember - add a pinch or so, sample and add more till it is to your taste. Baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent (as an example) to other dry ingredients and liquids used. Again, flavouring is a very personal matter. I would like to thank Karen Johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch, with no condensed soup and artificial flavours! To quote from a book called Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, I read in my early 20&#39;s &#34;Knowledge is communicable, wisdom is not.&#34; One of my Mom&#39;s favourites: &#34; We get too soon old and too late smart!&#34;"

I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Upon eating one bite, he says, &#34;this has to go into the rotation!&#34;. We both then devoured the tastiest chicken pot pie ever created. I did do a few things differently. I seared 5 chicken breast strips in vegetable oil  that I coated in garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I  was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish. I used one whole can of drained carrotts, and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for. After adding the cubed chicken I cooked prior, the recipe was still enough for 2 pies. I did not have 4 pie crusts so I used my largest round corningware casserole dish in place of a pie pan, which provided room for the entire mixture. It worked perfectly!

It&#39;s definitely time consuming to make, but having 2 spare in the freezer makes it worth it. Plus I love it so much!! The reheat from frozen instructions are spot on. If you haven&#39;t tried this, you are missing out!"

Made half the recipe and wanted to reduce time by dicing up 1 cup of small new potatoes from a can for starters..  added about a cup of fresh mushrooms diced up along with onions  to saute in butter.  Substituted 12 oz package of mixed veggies for all other veggies -- will use more next time.  Used over-flowing 2 cups of rotisserie chicken along with &#34;jell&#34; from drippings in container.  Mixed everything together along with 1/2 cup of sour cream and placed in 11x7 casserole dish and topped with Parmesan cheese and then small cut-outs from pie crust.

Fresh thyme works best in my opinion..... especially if you can find lemon thyme. (It is easy to grow too. Best in 12x12 x12  inches deep pots and potting soil. Use started  small plants rather than seeds. So easy and cheaper in the long runI like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well. The only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand. I save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer.

I&#39;ve been wanting to make a pot pie for years; my grandma used to make them, but i dont have her recipe, so just beginning to experiment.   It was 10 degrees and snowing, so today was the day.I had to make it dairy-free, so substituted the butter with bacon fat, and just used a bit more broth, and the liquid from the corn (i used canned, not frozen), to replace the milk; total abot 4.5 cups liquid.   Next time I think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk; all we had in the fridge was almond milk, and I didn&#39;t think that would work well.I also cooked down some portobello &#39;shrooms  (about two cups before cooking) in the pan first, and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions.   I pretty much followed all the other measurements.  Oh, added a bit of ground clove, too.It was really great.  My two boys &amp; wife loved it; it was gone in minutes.  I made just one pie  (only had one box of crusts) in an extra deep 10&#34; stoneware pie pan, and still have enough filling left over for probably another small pie.  But tomorrow is another snow day, and I suspect the kids will warm it up and have it for breakfast.  That&#39;s how they roll."

For the baked chicken pie, my grandmother always added a few hard boiled eggs, diced.  Made the gravy silky and adds a extra punch.  She also made gravy on the side in the event someone wanted their&#39;s extra moist.  You cannot make and freeze these if you use hard boiled eggs.

First, I use only fresh veggies (except for the peas and pearl onions). It adds time but fresh carrots, parsnips, and Yukon Golds make a difference. Next, I add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute. To keep this flavorful I roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned. (Much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock, upping the flavor considerably.)  I also add a glug of sherry (or white wine, whichever is handy) to the simmering sauce.  Finally, I use the TOF site&#39;s buttery, flaky pie crust as the topper. It doesn&#39;t take long to make (and I only let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes) and is delicious on this pie. Yes, I&#39;ve increased the work and time but if you do, this is likely the best pot pie that&#39;s going to come out of your kitchen."

I clicked on some of the other reviews that were 1/2 stars because I couldn&#39;t imagine why no one would like this. My best guess if you think it is too flour-y or too much thyme, then maybe try again because honestly I make these for anyone who is sick, birthdays, neighbors....and they rave constantly.  Maybe a misstep in the recipe was done.  The directions are correct and I like that they have the  frozen bake time! It is listed separate for easy understanding!  I love being able to have a frozen option such as this instead of soup/chili all the time."

My husband loved it.   The prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes, onions and carrots, count on prep time of  at least  1 1/2  hours.   If you buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco or another store , you   need to buy two chickens   for this recipe.  This recipe makes 2 LARGE pies.  It&#39;s enough, supposedly, to feed 16 people, but realistically 2 pies will feed about 8-10 adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie!  We are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie... it&#39;s so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner.   The diced potatoes get  &#34;lost&#34; in the pie- maybe I should cut them in larger pieces next time.    This would be a great hit for a pot luck."

I added another 1 tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasn&#39;t enough ( this took the flavor from just ok to yummy), and I was out of peas so I used cut green beans.  Prep time took me a little longer than I expected but was worth it in the end because I get two pies out of the deal.  I also ran short on crust (I had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie, so I only had 3 and needed 4), so instead of fully covering both pies, I just used cookie cutters on the 3rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes; kids loved it.  Filling comes out firm so it doesn&#39;t spill all over.  Also, even though boxed crust says to cook at 450, I did what the recipe said and did 425 for 35 mins (in gas oven) and it was perfect.

We have 6 children, so both pies would go in a single meal when all the kids were home!  Now I can usually freeze one for later--unless some of my sons find out I&#39;m making this &amp; decide to come home for supper that night!  I substitute 2 cups of frozen corn for the peas as my husband hates most vegetables.  I&#39;ve also made it with only the potatoes &amp; onions.  And, I use 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning instead of thyme because I don&#39;t like the flavor of thyme.  My youngest daughter made it on her own for her 13th birthday because I only had the use of one arm at that time--I talked her through it &amp; she was very proud of the compliments she received!"
