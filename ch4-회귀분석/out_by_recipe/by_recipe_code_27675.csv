( I didnt even save the recipe. )  To my surprise it was wonderful.  Not too overwhelming  taste of peanut butter .  It was perfect taste of chocolate and peanut butter, still tasting the cheesecake.  I used a package of chocolate Graham crackers instead of oreos. And I drizzled the chocolate fudge topping to make it look like lattice instead of covering it.  no peanut butter cups were needed. It was awesome. Everyone loved it . Definitely 5? took 2 days to find the recipe again but now its saved in 2 places !!!!!"

It has always cracked in the past, so this year I baked at 325°F for 55 minutes with a pan of water in the oven, then turned off the oven and left it in oven with door cracked  for 15 more minutes. No cracks in cake! Also helpful to know: 1.25 c Graham Cramer crumbs is 11 crackers; 0.25 c Oreo crumbs is 3 Oreo cookies."

I needed to make it gluten-free, so I used only GF &#34;graham&#34; crumbs, increasing the amount to total both kinds of crumbs. Instead of hot fudge topping stirred into the chocolate layer, I melted dark chocolate into some milk and stirred it into 1/3 of the batter. I left 1/3 plain, and I stirred the peanut butter into the other 1/3. I layered them in the pan, chocolate on bottom, plain in the middle, and PB on top. I baked it about an hour and 10 minutes. Tomorrow I&#39;ll melt chocolate in milk again and put it on top as a ganache, with PB cups chopped on top. (I used the recipe on this page to make GF PB cups: https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/homemade-peanut-butter-cups.)

I am confused by the name because it tastes nothing like a peanut butter cup.  The peanut butter flavor is hardly evident and the fudge poured on top doesn&#39;t add much to the flavor.  Except for the pb cups for garnishes, where is the comparison to a pb cup?  The crust came out hard, too and I didn&#39;t overbake it.  I just was not thrilled with this cheesecake.

I just used 1 cup and a half of the Lifestyles cookies and it was delish.</p><p>- Instead of hot fudge ice cream topping, I used nutella. ALSO DELICIOUS.</p><p>- I noticed that the peanut butter really did not make an appearance in the final product (maybe I did something wrong), but the peanut oil seeped out of the springform pan and onto the cookie sheet. Which I don&#39;t think was a problem, but maybe add more peanut butter? OR perhaps mix it into the batter?</p><p>- I misread the instructions, and melted butter for the crust, but then (Stupidly) measured out 6 tbsps of the melted stuff and only put that in. The crust was definitely drier than I would&#39;ve liked, it, so don&#39;t make the same mistake as me. Always add a lot of butter.</p><p>-I also didn&#39;t have an electric mixer, which resulted in a pretty lumpy batter. Luckily I had some extra muscle on hand to stir it up, but I think an electric mixer would have made things easier :p</p><p>- I added cut up peanut butter cups into the batter (before I poured the chocolate part on) and it was SUCH a good idea. They melted into the cake, and it was impossible to see them, but they definitely made the cake richer and more velvety. They added a distinct &#34;peanut butter cup&#34; taste. Very good.</p>"

You can&#39;t go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate!  I made it according to the directions except I doubled the reese&#39;s cups on top.  I took it to a Thanksgiving carryin and everyone raved about it.  Just make sure everyone sees it when it is whole because cutting it ruins the pretty look! My slices looked nothing like the photo!  But that&#39;s why magazines have food stylists!  Most amazing flavor and I will definitely be making it again!  The only thing I might change is the crust and make an all oreo crust!

I did not change one thing in the recipe.  If you&#39;re a chocolate peanut butter fan who also likes cheesecake, you have to try this!  One warning, though.  I made homemade fudge sauce for the top, but the recipe I have gets hard when chilled.  Luckily, I had time to go to the store and buy a jar because the other would have been too hard to cut through without tearing the cake apart.  For once, a store-bought ingredient was better than homemade."
