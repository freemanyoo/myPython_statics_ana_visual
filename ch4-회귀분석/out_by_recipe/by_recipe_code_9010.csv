What I found I didn&#39;t care for was the filling that went into the apples.  The white sugar/cornstarch/water/melted butter left an odd flavor, bland and odd at the same time.  Maybe instead of white sugar, I would use brown sugar with some spices such as cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg."

Went together fine and liked not having to get out the rolling pin.  I cooked the sugar, corn starch and water for the filling in the microwave---so easy that way them added the apples.  I also added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg because of personal preferences.  Flavor was excellent.  My complaint is that the topping got very soggy quickly.  Maybe it was kind of apples I used or fact that I stored pie in a Tupperware pie container with a tight fitting lid.  Anyway, I am going to make another pie shortly to take to a gathering tonight."

My first attempt was less than great, but some was my own fault. I forgot the vanilla, but the amount of apples also seemed far too many for the size of the pie pan. I had apples and sauce overflowing! Even so, it tasted OK and was easy to do, so I tried it again.  My second effort I limited it to 2 cups of apples, mixed granny smith and golden delicious. I made certain to include the vanilla, and also added a bit of cinnamon to the apples. In addition, bc I have a real sweet tooth, I added an additional 1/2 c brown sugar to the topping portion. This adjustment turned out GREAT! I made one for myself and took one to a church dinner. Thanks. I plan to make another for Christmas dinner."

I also had some trouble with the cornstarch clumping up in the water no matter how long I boiled the water.  So I wound up with a few gummy clumps in my pie.  So next time I make this I would have to add the cornstarch slowly.  Also, I baked mine for 40 mins and it was too long.  My crust was hard and it was darker brown (not like the picture)...but then again, I should have known because that is how my oven is...SO YES, I would definitely make this again and just bake it for less time  and would also solve my cornstarch problem.

I have to agree with the other folks. Make your pie filling with spices or it will be bland. I didn&#39;t cook my filling. I went old school and dumped the raw apples, cornstarch, and everything in a bowl, mixed it together, and it baked up just fine. One tip I think you may find useful is you can also use instant oatmeal packets. Just cut back on the brown sugar for the topping (I used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar).  Also, I doubled the recipe for the crust and the topping using 2 packets of Apple Cinnamon oatmeal for each, for a deep dish pie. I just found that saving a cup wasn&#39;t enough for the topping, but boy was it delicious! I used a combination of 3 each Jonathan and granny smith apples and it turned out mighty tasty.

I won&#39;t make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didn&#39;t set right, but I will be using the crust recipe (a 3/4 recipe) for the next pie I make.  Perhaps that will turn out better.Reserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick, so I reserved about 1 3/4 cup, which turned out nicely.  I used 2 different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in.  Unfortunately, this still didn&#39;t really give the filling any flavor.  I was amazed at how thick the water/cornstarch/sugar mixture got after boiling, but it was really jelly-like when I took it out of the oven.  I was worried that it wouldn&#39;t set as it cooled, and it didn&#39;t really.I will say though, that EVERY TOH pie recipe I read calls for a 9&#34; pie dish, but EVERY ONE I make NEEDS a 9.5&#34; Deep Dish pan.  Don&#39;t believe what you read in the recipe; it doesn&#39;t fit in the smaller dish."
