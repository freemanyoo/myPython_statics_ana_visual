However, it has WAY too much sugar in it for me.  I doubled the recipe to make it the same as my regular pancake recipe--meaning it now calls for 2/3 cup sugar!  My normal pancake recipe only has 2 tablespoons of sugar for the same amount of flour/oats.  Because we use syrup on our pancakes I don&#39;t feel like I need my pancakes to be sweet too--its just added sugar that is unnecessary.  So, next time I will reduce the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a delicious recipe.   (also they brown quickly due to all the brown sugar in the recipe, just turn down the heat so they cook a little more slowly and you&#39;ll be fine)"

I added a small scoop of applesauce after reading all the reviews that talked about such thick batter.  My batter wasn&#39;t thick at all but I also didn&#39;t have whole wheat flour and just used all regular gluten free flour.  That might have affected the thickness as well.  Plus I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and topped them with blueberries and raspberries. These were really wonderful.  Not as heavy as I thought people said in other reviews but definitely filling.  Really great recipe and definitely a family pleaser.

We only have regular oats because we eat oatmeal and reg. tastes better but worked fine-I soaked the oats for 10-15 mins in the buttermilk while I mixed dry ingred. and cooked sausage. had to add another tbl or so of milk after combining all ingred. one note: they don’t really bubble to indicate ”turn now” by time they really bubble, too done, so check early on!"

I made the recipe as listed, and then I added an extra glug of buttermilk, a capful of each almond and vanilla extract, and a very ripe banana. Also I didn’t want to wash my 1/3 cup so I eyeballed the brown sugar. I ended up leaving it in the mixing bowl to soften up the oats for Maybe 5-10 minutes while I started coffee and then threw that batter on a griddle, cooked those puppies up, and inhaled 3 while they were still warm and covered in smashed strawberries and blackberries. The recipe made 9 good-sized pancakes that were soft, fluffy, and tasted a little like banana bread. I’m sold."

Too sweet for me which I&#39;m pretty sure is the first time I&#39;ve ever said that!  It is tasty  though. I cooked on a low heat but the pancakes stuck to the nonstick griddle because of the high amount of sugar.   If I made again I would reduce the sugar. On the flip side (see what I did there) you don&#39;t need much syrup or jam to top them.

When I read the ingredients it sounded like nothing I ever tried so I wanted to review it for sure. I was expecting them to be really sweet but they weren&#39;t at all. The batter was much thicker than I am used to but that was just fine. I didn&#39;t have whole wheat flour so I just used regular and I had no buttermilk so I used what I had in the fridge. The only thing I would edit about the directions for this recipe is you should have a cooking temp on there because I didn&#39;t realize that they should be cooked at a lower temp because of how thick and it seems a few others had that issue as well. If someone would like thinner pancakes they could easily just add more milk until the get the right consistency for them. Great recipe really nice job I will make it again for sure. Thanks for sharing!

I&#39;ve begun adding a chopped apple and a handful of chopped walnuts to the batter - takes it up another notch.  Because this batter is so thick, I cook them at a slightly lower temp on the griddle - otherwise they tend to get overly brown on the outside before the inside is done.  I use buttermilk powder - stirring the powder in with the dry ingredients and using 1 cup of water with the other wet ingredients (egg and oil). As long as I have all of the ingredients on the counter, I make up several batches of the dry ingredients in zipper bags and store them in the refrigerator.  Makes a really quick and easy meal any time of the day!!"

When I saw this recipe (we love pancakes) I decided to make them, BUT I did make a few changes.  I replaced the whole wheat flour with white whole wheat, which is not as bitter as whole wheat flour and the brown sugar with a Tablespoon of Agave syrup (which gave it a little more moisture).  I also  replaced the vegetable oil with the same amount of extra light olive oil and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  The pancakes - YUM !!!!!!!   You could  also replace the brown sugar with a tablespoon of pure maple syrup which would give it a little more brown sugar taste.  I never use whole wheat flour anymore, I strictly use the white whole wheat which can be used in recipes calling for whole wheat flour."

They were very good, I loved the texture and hint of brown sugar taste!  Great for a change.I keep dried buttermilk on hand, but after reading another review, thought I would add that you can also use 1T. vinegar plus enough milk to make 1 cup as a buttermilk substitute.I usually make a large batch of waffles, then re-heat in the toaster, but for some reason, these seemed a bit dry when I re-heated them.

They were the lightest and most flavorful pancakes I&#39;ve ever seen.  The wonderful nutty sweet flavor is sadly hidden when you add the syrup (although you don&#39;t need much) and butter.I got 7 pancakes from the recipe using the 1/3 c. measure.  I didn&#39;t have wheat flour so made them with 1 c. all-purpose flour and it worked fine.  I read a review about the cakes being dry.  That is my thought on using wheat flour.  I have never made anything with it that hasn&#39;t turned out terrible dry so I&#39;m wondering if her cakes were dry from the wheat flour and not the oatmeal.Here is something I tried for the first time and I was amazed.  I never buy buttermilk so was reading the other day to see if my method of adding 1 T. lemon juice to 1 c. of milk is a close substitute.  The article said that it is fine but sometimes will give off the taste of the lemon.  They suggested the closest sub to buttermilk is to add 1-1/2 tsp. cream of tartar to the dry ingredients for very cup of milk.  They said it is very hard to find any differences in using that compared to products made with buttermilk.  Maybe that&#39;s why they were so light they nearly floated off the plate!

I thought the oatmeal seemed a little dry in them, so next time I might add a little more milk and let them sit a few minutes before cooking them.       Update- I have found that if I let the batter sit for a few minutes before making them that the oatmeal is no longer dry in the pancakes and they are perfect!
