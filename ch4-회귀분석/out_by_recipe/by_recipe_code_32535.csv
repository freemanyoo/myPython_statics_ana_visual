It&#39;s always a hit.  I do, however, toast the pecans.  I never liked having to heat up the oven to toast a few nuts and always found the fry pan gave me unreliable results.  So now I do it in the microwave by melting a generous teaspoon of butter on a microwave safe dish and spreading 1/4 cup of chopped nuts on it.  Microwave for a minute and stir.  Microwave one more minute and stir.  In my microwave that&#39;s all the time I need.  Let cool.  So easy."

I mix at least a cup or so of chopped walnuts or pecans in instead of sprinkling over the top, and I didn&#39;t care so much for the brown sugar, so don&#39;t use it at all.

My recipe calls for almond extract and a little brown sugar in the dressing also but is otherwise the same. The biggest challenge to me is getting the grapes dry after washing so that the dressing sticks. Otherwise it just slides off. Not a cheap dish but certainly tasty and someone always asks for the recipe.

I&#39;d always considered that doing anything to grapes except eating them right off the bunch was gilding the lily, but after tasting this, I decided if you are going to &#34;gild,&#34; this was the gilding to do! I&#39;d never made this myself before today, though. We had a bunch of white grapes that were just a bit too tart for us to enjoy eating by themselves, so I mixed this up. It&#39;s so quick and so easy, and very forgiving of substitutions--I found that I didn&#39;t have sour cream, so used 0% plain Greek yogurt, and then discovered that I&#39;d accidentally grabbed fat free cream cheese at the store, which is a slightly different creature to me than regular or lowfat. And I had no pecans, so I chopped up some almonds. Even with all that, this came out wonderfully, and tasted very similar to what I&#39;ve had in the past at various gatherings."
