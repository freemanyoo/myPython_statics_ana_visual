I use a small cookie scoop and then it makes more cookies. The spice is just right so you can taste it but it’s not overwhelming. My young daughter has always said this is her favorite cookie.

These use less Molasses and smaller amounts of spices so therefore they were flat tasting to me. I use 1/2 cup molasses and 2 t.of spices will return to my old recipe.

When I found out I had a gluten allergy, I had to stop making them (they didn&#39;t have good gf flours then). However, this year when planning cookie gifts for Christmas, I remembered these cookies and found this online version of the recipe. I LOVE these cookies and so does anyone who I make them for! 
This time, to avoid my hands getting so sticky from shaping the balls, I took out about a tablespoon of dough and threw it into my sugar bowl and coated it with sugar and then shaped the ball. This really helped speed up the process and my hands didn&#39;t get so messy. 
Also, I recommend taking the cookies off of the pan almost immediately. With the last pan, I didn&#39;t do this immediately and the cookies collapsed slightly."

I multiplied the measurements by 1.25 and it makes 3 dozen even with my scoop size (which is around 2 tablespoons in size). My dad loves &#39;em and he&#39;s not easy to please with cookies! I&#39;ve made a LOT of fail cookies. They&#39;re either too moist and somehow bake up crunchy or doughs that are too dry and flavourless. This has a lot of great flavour and you don&#39;t have to be shy about kicking up the flavour. I increased the cinnamon and ginger in this recipe to our tastes and added a teaspoon of vanilla with amazing results. A+ cookies!

If you bake much, the lack of vanilla extract, and the small amount of salt would jump out at you right off the bat.  Also, for those having trouble getting them to be thick an chewy, remember that it&#39;s virtually impossible to over mix dough until you&#39;ve added the flour.  Get it good and fluffy.  Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times if you&#39;re using a stand mixer.  I made the following changes/additions, and the richness of the flavor was extremely popular with friends.  3/4 tsp salt 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tsp Lebkuchengewurz (German Gingerbread Spice)  I use a #40 disher for consistency.  My old convection oven would finish them in 12 minutes.  My recent one takes 14 minutes."

I read through the comments before starting and was worried about the issue with the runny batter, spreading cookies, etc., but I proceeded anyway and the dough turned out perfectly and there was absolutely no major spreading in the oven whatsoever! I did follow the tips about creaming the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and also chilled the dough for 20 minutes before scooping and baking. I&#39;m really not sure why some people had such problems with it, maybe their butter was too soft. I will say that for my family&#39;s taste, I did need to add additional spice. I added a whole extra teaspoon of the ginger and increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and honestly, I could&#39;ve done with even more, which is why after tasting the test batch I rolled them in a cinnamon sugar/pumpkin pie spice mixture. The texture is exactly what I was looking for: soft and chewy with just a touch of crispiness on the outside. These will absolutely be in my Christmas cookie line up for every year to come."

Family and friends look forward to them every Christmas and I *have* to make them no matter what other cookies I make.  I make a few changes to best suit our taste, but nothing that significantly alters the recipe and they come out perfect every time.  I use Crisco butter flavored shortening to keep the cookies from flattening out too much; 1/2 C. granulated sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar; 1 tsp. each ginger and cinnamon, leaving the amount of cloves the same; roll the dough into 1-inch balls to get 48 cookies; and only dip the tops of the dough balls in granulated sugar before baking, finding that adds enough for us.  The recipe doubles easily, which is good so we get some for us to enjoy after giving lots away!"

The ginger flavor isn’t super noticeable though, if you, like me, crave the warmth of a strong ginger taste. I’ve made a couple modifications to make these cookies healthier and tastier while not compromising the softness of the cookies: 1. Replaced half of the flour with ragi flour. Ragi is a finger millet and has high protein, mineral, and fiber content. 2. Reduced butter to 8 tbsp. With the additions below, there is extra moisture in the batter and no need to use as much butter. You could in fact reduce butter further to 7 or 6 tbsp since I found my batter a little sticky and hard to form into balls. 3. Increased ginger to 3 tsp 4. Added half a cup of shredded coconut 5. Added half a cup of flax seed powder   I haven’t had a problem with the cookies spreading out too thin. In fact I’ve had the opposite issue of them not spreading out enough. It may have to do with where I am located - even in the summer it’s quite chilly. I leave my egg and butter out to let them warm up to room temperature, and use a stand mixer so they get nice and fluffy. I also use molasses which is super sticky, so that may contribute to reducing the spread."

The flavor of these cookies was good, although I think next time I&#39;ll add a little more ginger and a little less sugar. Also, like many other people here, the cookies spread out a lot and became flat once I took them out of the oven. This made them weirdly floppy? I chilled the cookie dough for 30 minutes before forming the cookies and then put them in the fridge again before baking them. Maybe next time I will add more flour or use less butter."

Followed recipe to a T but did sift the flour and dry ingredients together as my ginger and cloves were kinda old. Note: when it says softened butter, I DID NOT microwave the butter. It was just room temp so took awhile before it appeared light and fluffy. In fact I was skeptical about it! Took awhile to achieve light texture and was definitely not fluffy. Proceeded on with the room temperature egg, etc. I did use the hand mixer for adding in the first 1-1/2 cups of the flour mixture but then switched to stirring. Then I made all the balls up. Then I got out a little bowl and put 1/4 cup sugar in as a guesstimate. I rolled the balls in that. It was more than enough. I baked mine 10.5 minutes in a gas oven. Took them out as the cookies cracked and puffed up. They are just perfect. Outside is firm but inside is soft. Best ginger cookie recipe ever!! Hope they will stay soft."

I keep seeing comments on the sugar amount, it\&#39;s 1 cup of sugar for the cookies. The additional sugar is to roll the cookies in once you have them formed into the ball. I put mine in a Tupperware container, place one cookie at a time in it roll it around to cover the cookie, then I place the cookie on a cookie sheet and bake. The amount of sugar changes depending on how big or how many cookies I make. I believe that\&#39;s why there\&#39;s no amount for it. I usually start with a cup and go from there. Best of luck."

Both times the directions and cook time came out perfect.  The second time I added 2 tablespoons of ground ginger opposed to 2tsp because I really love Ginger.  I felt that the first batch had too much of the clove flavor and not enough of the ginger.  I used Wakaya pink Fijian ginger which is a high impact ginger, mainly to add a more healthy twist on this delicious recipe. I did not change the amount of cloves. This is now quite possibly the best tasting cookie I&#39;ve ever had.  My wife is a big Baker and she thinks that they&#39;re possibly the best cookie she&#39;s ever had."

The key to getting these to stay soft is to not over bake them (which is very easy to do) 10-12 min max. You almost have to take them out before they look totally done. Also, for those who had issues with spreading, it&#39;s likely also because of the use of only butter in the recipe. Butter makes cookies flatter. I used half butter, half butter  butter flavored crisco and that did seem to help. I think next time though I would use all crisco though.  I also nearly doubled the spices, I tasted the dough first and it just didn&#39;t have that ginger taste I was going for so I adjusted. Instead of rolling in sugar, I used a hard cookie glaze and dribbled it over them-- came out pretty great!"

My mom never made molasses cookies or gingersnaps much, probably because my dad didn&#39;t care for them.  He preferred peanut butter or chocolate chip cookies (which I still make for him, now that my mom has passed away).  So I did a search on the TOH website and came up with this recipe.  Read the reviews and added a couple of tbsp. of chopped crystallized ginger to the dough, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  The cookies turned out fabulously.  My daughter&#39;s classmates and teachers hoovered them up and she received three requests for the recipe.  The cookies are soft, but that coating of granulated sugar makes for a nice thin crisp glaze.  We will definitely be making these again."

I LOVE a robust, full of deep flavour ginger cookie and each time I have tried a recipe (I have tried about 3, I have ALWAYS regretted not adding more of the spices). The alteration I made was: 3 tsp Ginger (instead of 2 tsp), 1 tsp Cloves (instead of 1/2 tsp) and 1.5 tsp Cinnamon (instead of 3/4 tsp). Also, as per previous reviews, I used 3/4 Cup Brown Sugar (Instead of 1 Cup White sugar). I also added in 1/3 cup molasses instead of the 1/4 cup!These where phenomenal!! nice and THICK, just like I was hoping for. Countless recipes before yielded thin, weightless cookies, that lacked in depth of flavour. Whereas these are thick, hearty and chewy. If you liked a fuller spiced cookie I would definitely recommend adding in the extra. I also didn&#39;t miss the added sugar because they were rolled in it anyway ;)"

Well, we needed cookie recipes so I decided to look on tasteofhome, and stumbled upon this recipe. We absolutely love these cookies, they are amazing, the molasses and ginger blend very well together and just like the title, they are big and soft! We make these all the time, my brother had some friends over and said that they wanted cookies so I decided to make these for them, and they ate the WHOLE batch! One his friends said that they were the best cookies he ever tried. Would definitely recommend making these cookies for any occasion. Happy Baking!"

I made the cookies a little smaller than the recipe said and cooked them for about 9 mins. Made 48 cookies... smaller ones are perfect as a snack or to give with a thank you note. The smaller ones are a tad bit crunchier on the outside, but still have a soft center."
