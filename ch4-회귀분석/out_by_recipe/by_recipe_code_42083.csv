Sorry, but even a little &#34;mushy&#34; I don&#39;t see how it would ruin the taste or make it gross. If it boiled over in your oven, and you used a 11&#34;x7&#34; Pyrex, it is because the recipe calls for an 11&#34;x17&#34;pan. Usually things boil over if your pan is too small OR your oven cooks too hot. My family thought it was great...I thought it was nutritious (hidden!), and we had fun all making it together."

Even though I found it in the Comfort Food Diet magazine, it still seemed a little heavy.  I made some substitutions.  I used 93% lean ground turkey instead of 90%  ground beef + used the entire 1.25 lb package instead of the 1 lb of ground beef called for in the recipe since I didn&#39;t want to freeze the extra 1/4 lb by itself.    I don’t like Italian dressing so used 1/3 cup v-8 juice instead of ¼ c It dressing.  Next time I will boost it to 1/2 or 2/3 c if I use the extra gr. turkey again.   Cut the number of flour tortillas to 2 per layer instead of 3.  Results in 8 WW points plus for 8 servings."

Even though I found it in the Comfort Food Diet magazine, it still seemed a little heavy.  I made some substitutions.  I used 93% lean ground turkey instead of 90%  ground beef + used the entire 1.25 lb package instead of the 1 lb of ground beef called for in the recipe since I didn&#39;t want to freeze the extra 1/4 lb by itself.    I don’t like Italian dressing so used 1/3 cup v-8 juice instead of ¼ c It dressing.  Next time I will boost it to 1/2 or 2/3 c if I use the extra gr. turkey again.
