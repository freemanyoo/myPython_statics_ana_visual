It&#39;s not going to be that thick chili-consistency, but the heat level is nice and kid-friendly as advertised. I made a few slight alterations: I used about 1 lb of chicken and 1 additional can of beans, since we like our chilies and soups on the chunkier side. I reduced the broth to 2 cups and used liquid from the canned beans when I crushed the 1/2 cup of beans as directed - though I did this with a fork, so it wasn&#39;t perfectly smooth.  The flavors are a nice blend, although I think I will increase the oregano and cumin to compensate for having more chicken and beans next time. The additions of cheese, avocado, and cherry tomatoes are delicious, and oyster crackers are good, too. My very picky son ate seconds - unprompted! Definitely a winner in my book!"

Since some commented it was more soup than chili, I did add more chicken.  I didn&#39;t adjust any of the spices so maybe that&#39;s why it seemed a little bland.

It is a small recipe that really serves 3 large servings instead of 6.  I made the following changes to just about double it.  I used 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 tsp of salt, 1 tbls pepper, 1 med. onion, 1 small can mild green chilis, 3 tsps dried oregano, 2 tsps ground cumin, 4 cans white kidney beans, 4 cups of chicken broth, 3/4 cup shredded cheddar and 3/4 cup shredded pepper jack.  Everything else in the recipe I left the same.  Cilantro is super important in this recipe as it pulls all the flavors together.  If you try it without, I think it&#39;s kind of bland.  Love, love, love this stuff!"

I quadrupled most of the ingredients except for the broth, using only 1 box and used 4 cans of Progresso beans, and 12 oz. of cheese. I served it with tortilla strips. Very good and mildly spicy. June, 2018 I didn&#39;t have cumin but put in Trader Joe&#39;s taco seasoning, chili powder &amp; paprika to taste. 2 cups chicken broth was too soupy; put in 3/4 cup instant mashed potato flakes &amp; 3 cans of beans. Tastes okay to me, no fellowship  verdict yet."

It was more soupy than I like so I pureed a cup of beans and and added it back to the chili. I also used a roasted garlic broth and additional seasonings to kick it up. I will be making this again very soon!

The only deviations I made were to use 1lb of chicken &amp; I omitted the salt &amp; instead sprinkled the meat with pepper &amp; Greek Seasoning (only because my Mom is watching her salt intake). I too noticed my consistency was more along the lines of a &#34;soup&#34;. I know I&#39;ll make this one again &amp; think next time I&#39;ll follow the recommendation of the recipe submitter &amp; add an extra can of beans &amp; maybe a 1.5lb of chicken.

I gave it only four stars instead of 5 because I thought it was a little too soupy.  I think when I make it again I will add an extra can of beans and probably a pound of chicken.  Overall though this recipe is very good.
