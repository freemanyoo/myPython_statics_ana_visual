It was good, but not great was the opinion of quite a few people. Luckily there were a lot of people so I only had a small bowl leftover.  If I make it again I would greatly reduce or omit the vinegar in the dressing and not use the water chestnuts since, I asked, and no one tasted them in the salad. Maybe using sliced or slicing the whole and not chopping would have made a difference?"

He used full-fat Miracle Whip and packaged pre-cooked rigatoni that he chopped up which was a little chewier than homemade. He cut the onion to one and used a mild onion. The chopping is a chore to say the least but he likes doing putzy stuff like that. Using sliced water chestnuts would trim some of the time off. Since he made it the night before, the dressing and onions had time to mellow.Exchanges I&#39;d make in the future would be half Miracle Whip and half yogurt, trying plain and then lemon. For salad meal, I&#39;d add add cheese cubes, ham, chicken, summer sausage, that lonely hotdog and sunflower or pumpkin seeds. Maybe whole grain pasta. Fresh or frozen peas, maybe pineapple tidbits or tomatoes.This was good as is but can be used as a base to expand ingredients."

Everyone was asking for the recipe. I used a mixture of red and green pepper, did not use water chestnuts, and added real bacon pieces.  I did not use the dressing mixture, I used a whole jar of Marie&#39;s Coleslaw dressing which is awesome.  Will be making this dish again."
