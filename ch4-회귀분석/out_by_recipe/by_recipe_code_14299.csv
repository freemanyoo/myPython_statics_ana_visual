Mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin.  I did set out the 2 creams when i first started the dish so they wouldn&#39;t be so cold.

This was Good! I did change/add quite a bit, but my favorite too to share is this: I saw a lot of people thickening with flour and gagged a little, lol! As a southern cook, my grandma taught me long ago to slowly sprinkle in instant mashed potatoe flakes to soups, etc! You don&#39;t taste the potato, it thickens Instantly and No Lumps!! Anyway... here&#39;s my other many, many tweaks: I used a cold store-bought chicken and sauteed a large, chopped Vidalia onion, half of a chopped red bell pepper, and added fresh, minced garlic to the veggies once they were softened. I didn&#39;t have green chiles, so I added two (Drained!!!) cans of Diced tomatoes with green chiles (one mild and one &#34;Mexican&#34; flavored, YUM!) Also, I had 2 cans of Canellini beans (white kidney beans) instead of great northern. As far as spice... I doubled or tripled the cumin- we like that flavor a LOT- and added a few handfuls of chopped cilantro. Also I seasoned the sauteing veg mix with the yellow Adobo and the Sazon Completa seasonings. Served this with chips, Monterey Jack cheese, guacamole and LOTS more fresh cilantro! So good but...sorry this was so long!"

If you like really thick chili, I would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour cream/whipping cream a bit (and maybe the cayenne pepper too then) or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned, but we thought it was really good as written! Just the right spiciness- I can&#39;t tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little &#39;bite&#39; in your mouth after eating it.

I adjusted this recipe slightly, based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I added 1/2 t. poultry seasoning (in place of Oregano). Used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I only had one can of chopped green chilies, so added a cup of chopped red, yellow and orange bell pepper. We like heat, so I used 1T of cayenne, and we added sliced jalape?o peppers and shredded cheese on top, forgoing the sour cream.  I used 2 c. of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and 2 T corn starch as a thickener.  There are so many ways to make white chili, that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning, based on the preferences of those you are feeding, you&#39;ve got a hit every time.  Our side was a handful of gluten free corn chips, but sweet cornbread would be perfect too."

I did make a few minor changes to adapt to my daughter&#39;s taste while keeping the essence and taste of the recipe in tact.I took a note from &#34;purplepentacle&#34; using fresh garlic along with toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds.My daughters do not like green chilies so I reduced it to one can. They also love the taste but not the texture of onions; because of this after sauteing the onion and garlic I pureed them along with the green chilies.We love cilantro and use it in most of my soups, so I doubled the amount used.I added 1/4 cup of rice. My daughter doesn&#39;t like the consistency of chili, so because of this and the addition of the rice, I used 48 ounces of broth; this gave it a chowder consistency.To make it healthier I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt rather than sour cream.I was in a hurry so I used a store bought roasted chicken. I added a splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34; of the chicken.I served it in small bread bowls. It was very stick to your ribs and is now a favorite."

I made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe.  First of all my daughters do not care for green chilies, so I used only one can. I also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic. My daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture.  Secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro, I use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups; so in this case I doubled the amount of cilantro. Additionally I added a quarter cup of rice. My oldest doesn&#39;t like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice I used a 48 ounce box of broth. This gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved. I used precooked roasted chicken so I added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34;.  Lastly to make it healthier I swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. All of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter."

Even though there were 9 soups, and it made a large crock pot full! I mixed the everything together, including the cream and sour cream before cooking in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. It turned out wonderful. I also only added 3 cans green chiles (1 1/2 the recipe instead of double) just so it wouldn&#39;t be too hot. Next time I will add all 4 cans because although it had a kick, it wasn&#39;t as much as I like. I also did as others have recommended and used instant potato flakes to make it creamier.
