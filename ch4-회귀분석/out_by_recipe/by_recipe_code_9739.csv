This recipe is similar to how we make ours, with the exception of lots of chopped onion, fresh celery and some chopped fresh spinach. No cheese, but I always add some chicken base and often a sprinkle of bouillon powder. I&#39;m perplexed how so many soup recipes leave those two flavorings out. Maybe because I use homemade bone broth that its needed. But it turns a mediocre soup into fantastic."

My moto is &#34;everything is better with bacon and cheddar&#34;.

My husband loved it and I tweaked it a bit....sauteed the onions and carrots in the bacon grease for added flavor, increased the amount of veggies by 25% and the broth by 50%, used half and half instead of milk, used minced celery (had no celery seed and trying to keep sodium low), added a tsp garlic powder, and lastly..... added 1/3 c mozzarella to tone down the velveeta twang. It was so creamy with soft chunks of potato - exceptional flavor (may try without bacon or half and half  next time due to heart health issues - any suggestions to replace the bacon?)  and it made enough for multiple additional meals which I plan to take the advice from others for various add-ons.

The only tweaks I made to it are: - No Carrots:  They make the soup too sweet. - Cheese:  I prefer using real cheese like medium cheddar or colby rather than the Velveeta. It melts fast if you shred it. On occasion I&#39;ll use 1/2 (or less) of the Velveeta and substitute the other half  with actual cheddar or colby. Real cheese will always taste better. - On occasion I&#39;ll use broccoli instead of potatoes - viola you have broccoli cheese soup!

I definitely recommend doubling the recipe if you are making this for a family, so you can enjoy leftovers! The few changes I made: I used Sargento sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed. There was no graininess in the texture, which sometimes can happen with pre-shredded cheese. I am not an expert cook by any means, but I was a little thrown off by the milk/flour mixture. I am used to making a roux, so that is what I did instead. To the roux, I added half and half (instead of milk) and the cheese. I then poured this mixture into the pot with the veggies/broth. I didn&#39;t think this recipe needed any salt, so I didn&#39;t add any. I topped each bowl with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and some green onions. So, so, good!"

Once they&#39;re crispy they&#39;re much easier to cut. Also I don&#39;t recommend the flour step, so far all potato soup I&#39;ve made has had the perfect consistency with just the potatoes getting a little mashed and the cheese doing its own thing.Also as others suggested, I recommend cutting the cheese back a touch. Velveeta is already very thick and provides a lot of its own unique flavor. I went majority cheddar cheese and about a five ounce block of velveeta.And, as a presence, I added some green onion into the soup verses on top."

Just made this soup using frozen hashbrowns and it turned out delicious! I used a little less bacon, around 3 cups or more frozen hashbrowns, and shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveta.

We loved it and agree that it is a keeper.  I did not dice the bacon. I cooked it until crisp.  I crumbled half of it and added to the pot with the potatoes and broth.  We used the remaining to crumble into our bowls.  I sauted the onions and carrots in about a tbs of bacon drippings before I added the potatoes and broth.  I used celery seed because I did not have fresh celery, but I plan to use fresh celery next time.  Also, to increase volume,  used 4 cups and milk and a little more than 4 tbs. flour.  My husband likes his soup a little thick.  This recipe is very versatile.  I am already planning when I can make this again, and maybe use ham instead of bacon.  Another great recipe for my collection!"

I researched many different recipes before finding this one and I will look no more. I made some changes but am sure the original recipe is just as good. I reserved a few tablespoons of bacon grease and sauteed finely chopped onion, garlic and three celery stalks until tender.  I used reduced sodium broth and bacon and increased amount of salt to 1 rounded tsp.    I also reserved some of the bacon for garnish with shredded cheese.  I used 1 can evaporated milk and half-half to equal 2 cups and then used 1 cup 1% milk to equal the 3 cups recipe calls for.  I  purchased cream of potato in case i needed to thicken but no thickening needed.  It was so creamy and literally &#34;hugged&#34; the spoon, I think the evaporated milk helped. Next time I will add another cup of potatoes. Thanks so much for the recipe!"

This soup was excellent! I did make a few changes. First, I doubled the recipe to make a nice size pot. I omitted the celery seed as DH does not like it, but I minced a small rib of celery and cooked it with the potatoes and other veggies. Instead of doubling the parsley flakes, I added 1Tbsp. dried parsley flakes and 1 Tbsp dried minced chives. I added equal amounts of melted margarine with the flour in a separate pot, then added the milk and cheese to make a cheese sauce. Once that was all thickened and cheesy, I added it to the potato/veggie mixture. It was great, and I will make it again!"
