I don&#39;t have room in my oven for three 9&#34; pans, so I bought a pair of 8&#34; Fat Daddio pans that are 3&#34; deep. I use a very light coating of Wilton&#39;s Cake Release and wrap my pans to keep the layers evenly baked. I split the full recipe between the two pans and baked them at 350 for 45 minutes. Perfect layers. I like the icing recipe on the back of the Hershey&#39;s Cocoa powder container. It spreads beautifully and stays soft and creamy for the life of the cake. You can even pipe decorations with it. This cake never fails to please."

Used dairy free sour cream and Earth Balance stick butter. Also substituted German chocolate for the semisweet. The cakes were very moist and stuck to the cooling racks a bit, but overall it worked just fine. My dairy-allergic son said he was surprised at how good it was being gluten free. It was his birthday cake and was unsure at first about having it GF, but he had 2 pieces!"

You will in no way taste those ingredients in the finished cake, they are used for volume, moisture and texture, this cake should taste wonderful.

I made this cake for the 4th of July (what&#39;s more American than chocolate cake, right?!) and it was a grand slam, home run with everyone!  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I added a generous dash of cinnamon to the batter with the other dry ingredients.  The cake came out exactly like it looks in the picture on the website.  It is so delicious, I can&#39;t stop eating it!  It&#39;s dense (I love dense cakes as opposed to light and airy, spongy cakes), super moist and full of chocolate flavor.  The frosting pairs perfectly with the cake.   The recipe made three full size, 9 inch layers, I just wrapped one layer in plastic wrap and foil and put it in the freezer for another day.  The frosting was more than enough to generously frost two layers, and then have about a cup leftover.  At first I was stumped because I never heard of &#34;leftover frosting&#34; before, not in my house!  This frosting recipe left enough leftover for us spoon-loving-frosting-eating adults, and more for another time!  I bet I could even frost 1/2 dozen cupcakes with the leftover frosting.  So to sum it up, if you love rich, chocolately, moist, dense cake with tangy, sweet, chocolately frosting of which you will have some leftover, then make this cake!  Thank you for sharing, Sandy!  This cake recipe deserves that winning ribbon!"

I did not use the frosting recipe because I made a ho ho cake and tried the cake because I didn’t have a chocolate cake mix.  I used 3/4 cup of sour cream because that is all I had on hand.  The cake was so moist and the best chocolate cake I’ve ever tasted.  I baked it in a lasagna pan instead. Thanks Sandy for sharing your recipe.

I’ve made it twice now and the reviews were outstanding. Very moist and dense. Be prepared and have some cake lovers ready to help eat it! Could halve the recipe and have enough for a smaller crowd. I read one review that said it wasn’t chocolatey enough or “lacked chocolate flavor”. So not true.... you can control the depth of chocolate flavor by the quality of the cocoa powder you use. Deep rich chocolate flavor with Scharffen Berger cocoa powder. This will forever be my chocolate cake recipe!!

It was delicious from the cake to the frosting. One problem I did have was it was a little dry and not as moist like I like my cakes. I don&#39;t know if I left them in the oven too long or what. I will try it again maybe with a little less flour the next time to see if that helps. Any advice would be appreciated.

I used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water, and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  After adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin. I&#39;ve never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it.  I baked 2 layers on the top rack and 1 on the bottom rack.  The top rack cakes were ready at the 30 minute mark so I pulled them out.The cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle, so I moved it to the top rack and baked it another 7 or 8 minutes.  The top of that 3rd layer had a funny darkened pupil-in-an-eyeball sort of center appearance, probably from the jiggling it received when I moved it to the top rack, but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted.  I made my own frosting (a butter &amp; cocoa powder version) that I know is delicious, since some folks mentioned they didn&#39;t like the sour cream flavored icing much.  The cake had a nice dense, moist texture and a great not-too-chocolatey flavor.  It makes a huge cake; mine was 4&#34; tall when assembled, so be sure to cut thin slices!  I will save this to bake again- we shared a huge chunk with the neighbors and are still enjoying leftovers!"

A quick tip to make sure that the cake has a good bake (or to make any cake bake well) is to have room-temperature liquids/soft solids. I allow the butter, eggs, and sour cream to get to room temperature before using them. I always keep my vanilla extract at room temperature. I also used cake flour and follow the tips on the cake flour box about how to compensate for all-purpose flour (it does make a difference for cakes, I promise.) While the batter does get more liquidy after adding the water, I wonder if Esteli had the oven pre-heated to the right temperature?If you don&#39;t prefer the frosting there are THOUSANDS of frosting recipes out there. Pick one that is highly rated by many people and try it. :)"

Just a note to other baker&#39;s, after cooling and resting this cake seemed to compress a tad more than most other cakes (I used shaped pans, bit had to do carving to get it right.

I live at high altitude and had to make adjustments to account for that.  I decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, increased the flour to 3 cups, increased the water by adding an additional 1/3 cup  and decreased baking soda to 2 1/2 tsp.  I made cupcakes instead of cake. I usually let my batter rest for at least 15 minutes before baking. However, I made my first batch as soon as the batter was loaded and the cupcakes rose okay but spread a little.  The batter that had a chance to rest made perfect cupcakes. They rose without spreading at all.  It&#39;s important at high altitude to not fill the pans too high.  I filled them to about a half to  3/4 inch from the top and it was perfect.  Unfortunately there are no magic adjustments that you can use for every recipe. It&#39;s all trial and error at altitude, but my adjustments luckily were perfect for this recipe."

Very thick three layers and super moist. I was not thrilled with the frosting. It has a sharp taste to it possibly from the sour cream.

Nonetheless I received many compliments and as some other commenters have said it does keep well for several days.

This is THE perfect chocolate cake and my new go-to recipe for birthday and other special occasions. I&#39;ve never had good luck with layer cakes but this one worked perfectly. First time I forgot to add water (love the idea of using coffee instead of water) but it still turned out fine. Second time the batter at the bottom of the bowl did not get mixed well and it STILL turned out okay. Each time I spread raspberry preserves between layers and on top prior to frosting. Love the silky smooth frosting. Then I made genache and poured it over the top--so rich and yummy. Can&#39;t wait to make another one!!!

Substituting the water with hot coffee or just adding a teaspoon or so of espresso powder to the boiling water is a great way to accent the chocolate flavor. Wonderful recipe!"

Tasted like it was made by a professional cake baker, provided 12 good-sized tasty slices.  Very rich, extremely smooth frosting.  The brown sugar cake baked precisely and was a good foil for the extremely rich icing.  I made this cake exactly as instructed.  Is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted."

I received a mixer for Christmas and have been nervous about trying it out. I have never been much of a baker but at the age of 55 i decided to go for it. I made a big mess in the kitchen &amp; ended up with dry cake  mixture all over the place &amp; myself, and despite trying to be careful I made the same big mess while mixing the frosting.  Nonetheless, the cake turned out beautifully in spite of my inexperience. I had a ball, but must admit - it was a lot of work.

It turned out super, it was moist  but not heavy , just  light.   The flavors were well rounded but not too sweet and the texture  was super.

So yummy! It was so fancy when sliced and displayed and all my close friends were demanding slices as soon as they saw it. My dessert was the first to go and EVERYONE declared it to be one of the best chocolate cakes they had ever had. The balance of the sour cream with the sugar kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet and it was more old school in recipe without the white sugar and with the boiling water and sour cream. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet bakers chocolate. The frosting is plentiful and delicious. And for a garnish, I crushed up some chocolate chips and dusted the top. It was a massive hit. Everyone declared it to be so moist and to taste like it came from a bakery. Definitely an awesome cake. Will be making it again for Thanksgiving."
