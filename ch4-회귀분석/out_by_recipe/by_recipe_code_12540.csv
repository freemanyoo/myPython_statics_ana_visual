I have made it with chicken, steak, and shrimp.  For the steak I added cilantro to the marinade.  It always tastes super fresh.  If you are a camper, this is a great and easy recipe bc you can marinade the chicken slices while they are in your cooler, and if you cut up more onions and peppers, you can make kebabs for a 2nd dinner and save money and cooler space.  I honestly love this recipe.  Its a go to."

I used onion strips rather than cubed to go with pepper strips. I had smoked chicken breasts (so pre-cooked) that I cut into strips and marinaded for an hour.

I complimented these with refried beans (recipe compliments of Ree Drummond), arroz rojo aka red rice (recipe compliments of Marcela Valladolid) and quacamole. For the two of us this was to much to eat for one meal but it was excellent the next day. Two tips: the refried beans freeze well for use at a later date, if you have plenty of left over quacamole smooth it out on top and gently add a thin layer of water, the next day pour the water off and you have quacamole that didn&#39;t turn brown."

Rather than slicing and cooking chicken, peppers, and onions, I use Trader Joe’s 12oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen Fire Roasted Peppers &amp; Onions.  I just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe.  When the chicken is done marinating, I just heat up the peppers n onions for about 10 minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and it’s done and delicious.  I also use Trader Joe’s whole wheat low-carb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories.  Doing it this way, total prep and cook time is about 20 minutes, but if you don’t tell anyone they’ll think you actually worked hard making it.  I love cheating."

Used boneless skinless chicken thighs because I prefer the dark meat. Added jalapenos with the bell peppers and Yellow onion, it was pretty dang spicy but I like a lot of heat. Also I added some of the marinade from inside the bag to the pan with all the veggies and put a lid on for the first 10 minutes to effectively steam them before blackening them on high. Served the whole thing on rice with refried black beans mixed in. Note: this recipe would also be great on nachos if you dice the chicken smaller or cook it whole and shred it."

Time was limited, so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for 1-4 hours, as directed by the recipe. We still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful! So much so, that when making it again, we will not marinate the chicken, as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less time/planning ahead.  Otherwise, there is not a thing I would suggest differently. I just wanted to point this out because often times the &#34;set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours&#34; deters one from choosing a particular recipe. So, I want to make it known that if you&#39;re looking for THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS but in a pinch for time, that is not a reason to pass this one up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This was printed off and put into our family cook book, as we will be making this often. Thank you for sharing! ?"

I always make extra (sometimes even doubling the recipe) because we really like to eat it the next morning with eggs. Sometimes, we’ll mix the chicken, onions and peppers with beaten up eggs in a skillet and just scramble it all together.

First I added 1 Teaspoon each of ground cayenne, ground ancho chile, and ground chipotle chile.  This gave it a deeper smokie chili flavor without adding much heat.  Since a added more powders I also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste.  I pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them.  When cooking the  chicken I started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side, removed them and let them rest of 20 minutes.  This left the chicken with nice grill marks and raw in the center.  I then sliced them into even stips and finished the cooking with the vegatables.  By cooking the chicken twice I could control the timing of the fajitas for the party we were having."

They were 10x more delicious and flavourful than any fajita I&#39;ve had at a Mexican restaurant, and a huge improvement compared to our local one.  Personally, I used more lemon juice and a little less cummin. But since i like a little spice, I used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing. Fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too! I&#39;ve made it twice now and both times it&#39;s came out super delicious!"

The only thing different was I let the chicken marinate overnight which was a good choice because the flavors infused into the chicken and I splashed lemon juice all over the final product to get it extra zest plus it just looks cool and like I know what I&#39;m doing. I don&#39;t. I&#39;m just good at following directions :) Absolutely delicious! This is now my go to fajita recipe!!

I made a couple tweaks as I don&#39;t have a grill.  Baked the chicken at 450 in the oven for 17 minutes (keeps the chicken juicy inside but cripsy out so you can kind of get that grill feeling). Also served with homemade guac.  See my full version here: https://goo.gl/4rfasy

Still came out amazing.  Family loved it!  It is definitely a keeper and a recipe worth repeating several times per year.  I actually turned on the broiler at the end, made up the fajitas by placing two tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil and preparing two large fajitas to go under the broiler, just until the cheese starts bubbling.  They added salsa and sour cream and wrapped them up.  Sauteing the vegetables in the remaining liquid left from cooking chicken is important.  Cooked until they appear burnt in spots. Incredible!"

This recipe is simple enough to be quick and easy and yet involves enough flavor to make you feel like you are simply amazing in the kitchen.  I typically double the marinade.  While the chicken is marinating, I chop vegetables.  I have been adding mushrooms lately and it&#39;s a great addition.  I cook the veggies first, be sure to add salt and pepper.  Then I cook chicken after marinating for at least 1 hour.  Mix it all together and voila.  I love to cook all the time, but this recipe has to be made regularly.  It&#39;s just that good!

Be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe, though. The citric acid will eventually &#34;cook&#34; the chicken (in fact, this is how ceviche is made). As for freezing the chicken--yes, it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken. However, if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken, the culprit is most likely a dull knife. Of course, many of us freeze chicken, but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat. Given a choice, I would always choose &#34;never been frozen&#34; chicken, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t freeze it just to make cutting it easier."

I felt they were a little bland so I revamped the seasoning to 2 tsp of cumin and 2 tsp of garlic powder and replaced the green onions with sliced red onions and 2 peppers  the color of the peppers depends on what I have on hand.Try yellow and orange peppers too. If you want to get rid of the after eating peppers burps try this: After slicing your peppers in strips soak in water for a few minutes and then drying your peppers with a paper towel. Then cooking. I can almost guarantee you won&#39;t be burping peppers all night.

Thanks to this recipe, my 2 toddlers are eating peppers and loving them.  I like to make a huge batch of the seasoning up at one time to have on hand.  This recipe also works perfectly if you want to make a freezer meal kit... just slice the chicken and put in a freezer bag - you could even make up the seasoning marinade and pour into the bag before freezing.  Then slice up the peppers and onions and put in a separate bag.  When it comes time to cook, just defrost the chicken in the fridge... the peppers and onions can be cooked right from the freezer.  One of my top recipes from Taste of Home ever, love love love this."
