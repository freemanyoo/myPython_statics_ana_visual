The frosting was a bit sweeter than we like, so this time I made a whipped strawberry cream cheese frosting.  Whipped a 1/2 cup of heavy cream in a cold mixing bowl, in a separate bowl, I beat 1/4 cup of unsalted butter with 4 oz. of cream cheese, stirred in 1/4 cup of pureed strawberries and 1/2 tsp of vanilla, then mixed in 1  1/4 cups powdered sugar; last step was folding the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture."

The strawberry smell and taste were terrific, but the cake, with the sugar in the Jello and the cake mix was far too sweet, The frosting was almost inedible it was so sweet when eaten with the cake. We scraped the frosting off and topped each piece with a dollop of Greek yogurt, and it was delicious but would have been equally so with whipped topping or ice cream. If I were to make it again, I would probably make it from scratch and reduce the sugar, and serve it unfrosted. I added some dried strawberries which I had processed (a couple of spoonful) to enhance the strawberry flavor"

Try reducing the water by a quarter cup or the strawberries by a quarter cup. Some experimenting may be needed to get the proper ratio.

The rim  of the pan was  also covered with batter which made removal from the pan difficult.   Followed the instructions exactly and didn&#39;t change a thing.  Think I&#39;ll cut back on the amount of strawberries in the frosting to avoid  a runny frosting.    It&#39;s for my grand daughter&#39;s birthday and I&#39;m hoping the frosting covers up the messy cake.

I made this as a birthday cake with an additional lemon cake layer per the request of my 17-year-old daughter.  Moist, homemade flavor even though it&#39;s from a box and has flavored gelatin. I was skeptical, but now throughly impressed. It was a real hit! I use a good avocado oil for baking instead of canola or veg oil. I used a food chopper to chop  strawberries. They were perfect! Not too fine and not too big. I used the frosting recipe - ingredients only but with different measurements, plus added cream cheese to it and made it as a filling between the layers ( not nearly as sweet that way, as others had mentioned), and frosted with White icing.  I tripled  this recipe and baked it in a 12 x 12 x 2 pan.  Only used about 2 1/2 of the recipes  instead of the full tripled amount to fill the pan.  It came out perfect!   I used  nonstick spray on pan as well as the parchment paper and sprayed paper. Do not let cake cool completely in pan. Only cool cake about 10-15 min on a cooling rack.  Took a knife and wen along the edges of the pan to release any possibly stuck sides. I noticed that the gelatin with the sugar may stick a little bit, but it&#39;s not bad. Then placed another piece of parchment paper on the top of the cake, placed cooling rack on top of the cake and while holding both cooling rack and pan flipped cake over and let it sit for a moment. Shook gently. Removed pan. Nothing stuck!  Just a thought, but  usually can&#39;t go wrong when a cake recipe begins with Mamaw."

Added small amounts of strawberries until i got the  right consistency desired.  Served the cake with a really good vanilla ice cream and dribbled a little of the remaining strawberry syrup concoction over the top. People made themselves miserable with second servings.

Yes, the frosting can get a little messy.  I usually have to cut back a little on the juice from the strawberries or add more powdered sugar.  I also store it in the  refrigerator so the frosting stays firmer."

Only thing, is that the juice from strawberries adds to the liquid in the batter... so it was a tad bit messy. It&#39;s OK I covered it with the frosting lol! I made this cake for my sister-in-law&#39;s b-day. I only used cake recipe, because I made a chocolate-covered strawberries cake. I made a chocolate pudding filling with left over strawberries. The frosting I made a cocoa whipped cream one. Then placed almonds on the side of the cake."

I used 2 egg whites, rather than the 2 eggs. I also baked this in 2 greased and floured 8&#34; square pans for 35 minutes-I used a cake tester to determine whether the cakes were done!  I&#39;d used 3 Tbsp. of the cake mixture to mix in with the chopped strawberries.  Instead of using a strawberry icing, I used 2 cups of confectioners&#39; sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice (bottled) and the 1/2 cup crushedstrawberries.  I&#39;d pricked holes in each cake with a fork and then drizzled the glaze over each cake.  The cakes certainly ARE moist! The feedback on this cake from other readers is also VERY helpful! I think that if I made the icing again, I will concentrate on that! I&#39;ve made cakes using Jello and I often resort to making a lemon glaze or other citrus-type glaze which runs down into the baked cake, making it extra moist!  When I added the water in the amount specified, I added it slowly to the batter! delowenstein"

I made it for my strawberry-crazy daughter-in-law and it has supplanted her  previous favorite. I am not too fond of strawberries, but this is going on my favorites list. I need to think about the frosting. Think I&#39;ll use the recipe frosting between the layers and then use a thinner version more as a glaze. It sure makes a generous portion. Also, this cake is better the next day or at least well-chilled. TRY IT AND YOU&#39;LL BE HAPPY!!!"
