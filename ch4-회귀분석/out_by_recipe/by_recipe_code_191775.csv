This time I chopped up a half pound of shrimp, cooked a package of shrimp-flavored ramen noodles and instead of putting together the spice mix used the seasoning packet from the ramen (I was inspired by Lillie583’s idea). Then, as suggested by another reviewer, topped with Yum Yum Sauce that I found on The Recipe Critic’s site<a href=""https://therecipecritic.com/yum-yum-sauce/),"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">,</a> we absolutely inhaled it. I plan to try this with ground chicken and chicken ramen next, and also again as written but over rice instead of noodles. Excellent, easy weeknight recipe that you can adjust as desired to keep things interesting, thank you for sharing!"

I haven&#39;t tried the recipe yet so I cannot rate it. But I was wondering if a person could use a package or two of pork flavored Ramen Noodles in place of the Rice Noodles? Along with that question would you need to adjust any of the other seasonings if you used the seasoning packets that come with the Ramen Noodles?

A few changes I made - used low-fat ground turkey instead of pork, one medium chopped regular onion instead of green onions which I don&#39;t care for, and a lot more soy sauce, as it needed extra seasoning. It makes quite a bit, and the leftovers freeze well."

I use the shredded coleslaw that includes shredded carrots and add additional shredded carrot until it &#34;looks right.&#34; I also add a little more ground ginger than called for, as we like the additional flavor. I now keep rice noodles on hand just for this recipe. I also save some time by browning a full pound of ground pork ahead of time in the sesame oil, separating it into two 1/2-pound packages and freezing it (just remember to label the package so as to not confuse it for browned ground beef). This dish goes together so quickly with these short cut hacks and you have a delicious alternative to time-consuming conventional egg rolls. Delicious flavor!!"

I make it using shredded coleslaw rather than chop up a head of cabbage.  We also use gluten free noodles and gluten free soy sauce so my 10 year old granddaughter with diet restrictions can eat it.  (I tried using the angel hair type rice noodles and prefer it with a firmer noodle.)   I added two slightly beaten eggs to the cooked pork and cabbage for a reason.  Years ago I made egg rolls for Asian friends and they told me I forgot to add the egg.  Adding the egg does not alter the taste of the egg roll noodle bowl ingredients.

Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, this recipe is just for the inside of an egg roll.  If you normally dip your egg roll in soy sauce, you&#39;ll want to add extra soy sauce to this.  I used finely shredded cabbage that came in a bag and put several baby carrots in a food processor for the shredded carrots.  I did the full amount for everything, but only did 3C finely shredded cabbage and 1C processed carrots.  This was because when I was putting them into the pan, these amounts alone looked like a LOT.  I couldn&#39;t imagine adding more.  I also did regular yellow onion, not green.  I thought the ratio of veggies/meat/noodles seemed pretty good too.

I initially thought the ingredients did not allow for enough &#39;sauce&#39; but it is so flavorful and it was indeed enough. I did, however, deglaze the pan after cooking the pork with about 1/4 cup of chicken stock because the spices got concentrated on the bottom of the pan. That didn&#39;t create more &#39;sauce&#39; because it evaporated - just wanted to get the good bits off the bottom of the pan. But that  I used leftover pork roast (cubed up) instead of ground pork. I also used more liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce and added another tablespoon (it needed more of that ingredient in my mind). Next time I make it I will probably use 2 oz. of the noodles instead of 4 (just personal preference - I would like more cabbage ratio than noodle). I did add one egg towards the end and scrambled it in the pan - didn&#39;t need it necessarily but I liked the added richness it provided. I added some chopped cilantro on top as I served it. This is a keeper and for me that&#39;s a big deal. I rarely go by recipes but I followed this one to the &#34;T&#34; and it was great."

This reminded my husband of his favorite dish at a fast food noodle restaurant. I liked it because I could control the ingredients and the cost per serving was a fraction of the restaurant price! The only changes I made were to add a bit more soy sauce to suit our tastes, and to use sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of ground pork. I think you could use any protein and get a great result. This has been declared a top 5 favorite meal in our house!"

I couldn&#39;t find rice noodles, so I used Japanese wheat noodles.  If I make it again, I would add more ginger and remove the turmeric.  My husband didn&#39;t care for it, unfortunately."

Make this recipe once and you will never forget how quick, and easy it is ! From pan to the table in no time at all.  I cut a few corners by using store bought coleslaw. It worked just fine. I also had no rice noodles so I broke up a handful of thin spaghetti *  That also worked just fine.  Winner indeed!JanieTaste of Home Volunteer Food Editor"

I love egg rolls and this was a great way to get the flavor without making them myself. I did not use the sesame oil, but coconut instead, and found a coleslaw mix at the store with preshredded cabbage and carrots. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My bag of rice noodles had the option to fry or boil the noodles, so I assumed that boiling was the option preferred foe the recipe. Will be making it again!"

You could probably add peas too.  I couldn&#39;t find ground pork so used ground turkey and it worked well.  Even my super-picky three year-old loved this.

The first time with ground pork and the second time with ground chicken. Both times it was great! I am even thinking about doing chopped up shrimp. Makes great leftovers. I might try taking some sliced and baked won ton wrappers to add to the top for some crunch. I sent leftovers with my husband with some Chinese mustard for his lunch and he loved it.</p>
