I should have realized from the batter that it needed more milk. Perhaps 1 cup would have been a better ratio- I usually use the Martha Stewart recipe. I also would suggest adding 1 tsp vanilla.

Tips: Make sure all your liquid/wet ingredients are at room temperature. I microwaved the milk to warm it up so that the melted butter wouldn&#39;t solidify once it was added to cold milk. For the eggs, I soaked them in hot water to bring them to room temperature then very lightly scrambled them before combining with the milk and butter. Sift the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients. Mix until combined but be careful not to overmix."

You must have beaten the batter way too much.  When using baking powder you are not suppose to overbeat/mix.  sounds like that was your problem.  The baking powder is what makes them so fluffy.  Also, you need to use a small fine mesh strainer to put the baking power through.  This will break up any clumps of powder.

I use 2 Tablespoons of oil instead of the melted shortening, and use buttermilk instead of regular.  The buttermilk will make the batter VERY thick, and you will need to quickly spread it out on the griddle, but makes all the difference.  You can increase the buttermilk to 1 C. to make the batter more pourable and the pancakes will still come out light and fluffy.   I have also doubled the recipe with equally good results."
