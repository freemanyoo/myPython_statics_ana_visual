They are so good. I baked mine in a 15 x 10 pan per the recipe, and had to make extra frosting, as there was not enough to cover the top (even with a very thing layer). 6 oz. of cream cheese is a strange amount. I used the whole 8 oz. brick, and added the proportion of powdered sugar and milk needed to finish topping the bars. I wonder if there&#39;s a typo in the recipe? Should it be 6 oz. of cream cheese, or should it have been 16 oz? Would have been plenty of frosting (maybe too much) for a 9x13 using 6 oz, but not enough for the 15x10."

Instead of sugar I have use Truvia cane sugar blend which only requires 1/2 the amount of sugar and has 75% fewer calories than regular sugar.  I also used 3 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as suggested in other reviews plus an extra sprinkle or two.  When I make this in a 11X15 pan I make a recipe and a half so  they do not come out thin.  Or I use a 9 X13 pan and bake for 30 - 35 minutes.   Instead of cream cheese frosting I just use a can of coconut pecan frosting instead.

I make something similar using three jars of baby food carrots in place of pumpkin (and 1/4 cup more oil) and they are to die for! (They are probably a brighter orange than pumpkin bars) I bake them in a sheet cake pan, which makes them more like bars. I also use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter in the icing, sticking to the 2 cups of sugar,  which means that they would be slightly less sweet. The frosting just covers them.To the person who asked about a substitute for cannola oil, you can use any kind of oil except for olive. My favorite is safflower oil, but I warn you that it is expensive. I love it in salad dressings and have used it in my carrot bars. It is very light.."
