I just don&#39;t understand why it was so soupy. I cooked my pasta al dente to have it soak up some of the juice. Next time I will omit the juice from the tomatoes and cut back on the chicken broth by 1/4 cup.

As usual w/ me, I tweaked it to fit my needs/taste. Even with doubling this, I used a bit more chicken, red &amp; green peppers, onion and garlic. Plus I used a bit less cheese (not a fan of too much ooey-gooey cheese). I used olive oil instead of canola oil.
Turned out exactly as I had envisioned. 
Oh, who came up with “35 min prep time”??. This was time consuming, but so is any homemade dish that requires this much cutting, blending, sautéing, etc. Be prepared for a cpl of hours. It was worth it. 
Love that I have left-overs ( the intention)! It tasted so healthy and so not-restauranty (which is usually so salty &amp; bloats me - yuck!)."

My daughter helped me last night and it was delicious. Easy to make and I&#39;m glad I had her help.  I ended up making a few changes by accident, I could not find a green bell pepper so we used the sweet red and orange pepper.  I did not have chicken thighs on hand so I used chicken breasts - I used 1.5 pounds. I added 2 cups of gluten free penne pasta.  Along with the spices (except red pepper flakes) mentioned to use I also added Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and black  pepper - did not measure just eyed it when added. I also added 1 cup of sodium free chicken broth due to the extra half cup of pasta. Cooked as instructed and the remaining uncovered was cooked for only 15 minutes. I did forget to add the romano cheese, no one really noticed. I will make this again and add into our rotation.  we paired this with a nice spinach salad. Looking forward to left overs."

I did do a few short cuts though.  I didn&#39;t blend the tomatoes and it turned out just fine.  I only simmered the chicken mixture 10 minutes and only left the dish in the oven for 10 minutes after uncovering.  It still was delicious.  Ground beef or sausage could easily replace the chicken.  I&#39;m not a big fan of chicken in red sauces but most dishes of this kind use beef or sausage so the chicken was a nice change of pace.  The chicken could even be shredded or cut very small so it&#39;s not as noticeable.  This could easily be prepared ahead of time for a busy next day.  Prepare the chicken mixture and refrigerate since it&#39;s the step that takes the longest or prepare the entire dish and bake it the next day.  We are a family of 5 and so there is only a few small servings left over.  Next time I may double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8.

I read previous comments as well prior to making. Yes it does take some prep time as people have statdd. Also, scared for it to be &#34;bland&#34; as I knew I&#39;d be leaving out salt to accommodate sodium-restricted family members, I took the advice of doubling up the other spices. I used mozzarella, provalone and parmesan for the cheeses. This was a HUGE hit with everyone and I love that it seems like this recipe could leave room for a lot of little personal tweaks and substitutions if one so chose to implement any. Definitely committing this to the recipe book!"
