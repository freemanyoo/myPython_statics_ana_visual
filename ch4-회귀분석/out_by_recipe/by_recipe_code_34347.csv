Comes out juicy, delicious, and limey! I followed the recipe after that. Very delicious! I&#39;ve never had lime chicken before but this was amazing. Even my 9 year old went crazy saying these were the best tacos I&#39;ve ever made. Thanks for the inspiration!"

I juiced 1.5 limes (used the other half of a lime for garnish), which was about 4.5 tbsp.  I cut back on the chili powder (about 1.5 tsp), and instead of mixing them, I sprinkled the powder on each piece of chicken, then poured in the lime juice.  I cooked it for 5 hours, shredded the chicken and added in the salsa and corn, then only cooked it all for an additional 15 minutes or so while my sides finished cooking.  The chicken was perfect.  I could actually taste the lime, but it wasn&#39;t overpowering.  I will be doing the same ratio next time.  We really loved this recipe, and it tasted great topped with some lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and avocado.  I&#39;ll definitely be doing this one again."

I had just over 1.5 lbs of chicken breasts, and after pretty much exactly 5 hours exactly it shredded incredibly easily. The flavor was really good too. I&#39;ve never been one to put salsa on my tacos or burritos (I&#39;m more of a pico de gallo person), this was super good. It also made enough that I&#39;m going to definitely get more than a few meals out of it. Easy, quick and cheap.By the way, I bought a can of corn, accidentally got creamed corn, and (while this was the first time I made this, so I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s supposed be exactly), I don&#39;t think it changed anything. The salsa has enough liquid that it got absorbed without an issue.I&#39;m definitely making this again."

I was a bit concerned when I started to make it thinking the lime and chili seasoning wasn&#39;t enough and the recipe would burn but it didn&#39;t and made it&#39;s own juices with it.  The only suggestion I have is to heat it longer than 30mins.  The finished product made a lot.  Was a bit drippy but was still very good.  Had plenty leftover meat mixture and used it for lunch the following date and crushed up some organic blue tortilla chips and mixed in with it.  Super yummy that way too!  Overall happy with this and would make it again since my picky family really enjoyed it</p>

We&#39;ve made tacos, burritos, and chicken taco salads with it. But the best yet, according to my son, was using the lime chicken mixture to make chicken enchiladas. Just roll the chicken in tortillas, cover with enchilada sauce, bake for 15 min. cover with shredded cheddar cheese and bake for another 10 -15 min. It was awesome!"
