I always used a full size cake mix, it was WONDERFUL!!!  Try looking on the &#34;Jiffy&#34; site!"

The directions were a bit confusing though...pudding doesn&#39;t come in 1-ounce packages that I could find (so I used a large instant vanilla pudding mix) plus the cooking time for a yellow cake was about 35 minutes, not 15-20. I may have used the wrong cake mix as suggested (I used a regular size yellow cake mix) because of the 9x13 pan. I also mixed the crushed pineapple with the pudding and cream cheese then spread it on the finished cake. Okay, I didn&#39;t use anything remotely healthy and went with full-fat cream cheese, pudding, milk, and Cool Whip.  The end result was fantastic and I will definitely make this again."

And the part where you are supposed to sprinkle the pineapple on, then try to spread Cool Whip over that? Really? That would  just make a mess, in my opinion. None of my ingredients are fat or sugar free or low fat. I used two Jiffy cake mixes.  I was out of instant pudding, so I used the Cook &amp; Serve pudding, cooled it and mixed it in with the cream cheese. The pudding blends nicely with the cream cheese.  In a bowl, I folded the Cool Whip  into the drained  pineapple and spread that on, then added some cherries on the top. I skipped the nuts.  It looks quite pretty. Haven&#39;t tasted it yet but it should be delicious."

Otherwise great!  I think it would be good with strawberries instead of pineapple to compliment the cream cheese.I used the recipe as a guideline, but made my own cake and pudding from scratch, and no fat-free or sugar-free stuff.

My 12 year old usually asks for a pineapple upside down cake on his birthday, but he said this year, he may ask for this one instead!  I bought a regular sized cake mix and just split it in half (1.25 cups of the mix).  I baked it cholesterol free by using egg whites and applesauce in place of oil.  Then I followed the instructions as directed, except that I used neufchatel cheese instead of fat free cream cheese because it has even fewer calories, and then I omitted the walnuts because my husband doesn&#39;t like them.  So with even less calories, I increased the serving size so there were 16 slices instead of 20.  It was excellent!  Even my 4-year old ate a whole piece!

I read the recipe over a few times because I couldn&#39;t believe you baked the cake only 10 to 15 minutes. I used half a regular cake mix since I couldn&#39;t find the 9 ounce one. BTW, I made the cake with the soda (Weight Watcher&#39;s)  and no oil or eggs or water to make it even lighter. A 12 ounce can of soda with one box of cake mix, beat together and bake. You can use any flavor cake mix and any flavor soda, try them all. Yummy!"
