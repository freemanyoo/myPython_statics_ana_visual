Never used capers cuz I never knew what they were and never had them but even without those, this recipe is really good! It’s very light and airy. Pair it with some rice and broccoli and you got yourself a quick affordable meal. Also, to the person saying this recipe is bland. I recommend using the lemon butter mixture before you cook them and when they come out put more of the mixture on it. This helps with the flavor. Btw if you’re not a huge fan of lemons like me, I would probably use alittle less lemon juice than it asks for cuz the lemon can get pretty bold compared to the other flavors. This makes a great meal prep also!!"

Everything about it works wonderfully and the taste is FANTASTIC. I do not enjoy fish much at all and I especially usually don&#39;t enjoy the taste of tilapia. I&#39;ve tried several recipes and they&#39;re &#39;OK,&#39; but this one made the fish taste terrific. I grabbed this recipe about an hour before I was to cook and was out of capers, so I searched for a substitution. My google search result recommened subbing with something tangy that has a bit of a bite to it, there were several options. I chose to substitute capers with a spicy baby dill pickle, all it took was one and it worked great! If you use a spicy baby dill, also, be sure to mince it up, really fine, because it spreads the flavor out evenly over the fish, when it&#39;s cut up tiny.  The only other substitution I made was using 1 tsp   fresh minced garlic (= 2 cloves), because I think it tastes better than garlic powder, just my taste preference. Everyone loved this recipe and I definitely will be using it whenever we eat tilapia, in the future! Well done, TOH!"

Capers are the unripened flower buds of Capparis spinosa, a prickly, perennial plant which is native to the Mediterranean and some parts of Asia. After the buds are harvested, they are dried in the sun, then pickled in vinegar, brine, wine or salt. The curing brings out their tangy lemony flavor, much the same as green olives.The size of the buds range from tiny (about the size of a baby petite green pea) up to the size of a small olive. The smallest variety from the South of France, called nonpareil, is the most prized and comes with an equally notable price-tag. Larger capers are stronger in flavor and less aromatic."
