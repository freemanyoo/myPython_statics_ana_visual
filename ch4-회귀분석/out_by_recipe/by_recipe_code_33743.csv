I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  It was very good.  I freeze peaches during the summer.  When defrosted, they give a lot of peach juice.  I used the peach juice, instead of the water called for in the recipe, to make the topping.  After reading other reviews saying it was too sweet, I cut out the white sugar in the topping and used only the brown sugar.  My husband said it was as good as my peach pie.  It&#39;s much less time-consuming than making a pie so I&#39;ll be making it again!"

So what do I do with all of that healthy fruit? Make desserts of course! I bought some peaches yesterday and then went looking for a recipe to try. I\&#39;m so glad I stumbled upon this one. It turned out really well. The only tweek I made was to follow the  suggestions of sprinkling lemon and sugar on the peaches, letting sit half and hour and using the bit of juice that accumulated in with the water part of the recipe. I don\&#39;t think it made that much difference so following spot on should come out just as well. I didn\&#39;t know what would happen with that water formula. But the top got all brown and crunchy, so good. And this was really easy to whip together on a Sunday afternoon. I will definitely make this again"

I thought the topping was going to overfill my baking dish (8x8 pyrex) after I poured about half of it in. I was contemplating transferring everything to a larger pan but after waiting a few minutes the liquid had soaked in enough to add the entire remaining amount. It is a MUST to let it cool off and set up or otherwise would have been soupy. Once cooled, it is a great “pudding” consistency. It is softer than a true cobbler but very good!"

This is a fantastic recipe when you have fresh peaches in the summer. It&#39;s probably good with frozen or canned peaches too, but I save this for when I have fresh ones. For the topping, you need to let it boil for a bit and reduce before pouring on the batter, think like syrup or even a caramel consistency. I add a little corn syrup to the topping mix just to prevent any crunchy sugar bits. The cream as indicated by the recipe is good, but some ice cream I think is even better. If you have fresh peaches, this recipe is a must-try."

Although I didn&#39;t follow the recipe to a T. I had to use bread flour because I was out of all-purpose (crazy, I know). I also used brown sugar instead of white. I used 3 fresh peaches, peeled/sliced and added 3/4 cup of fresh blueberries. Upon reading the reviews I decided to go with my own topping recipe.... I used a half stick of butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a splash of milk. It made a saucy caramel. I drizzled half of it over the batter and baked it at 400 for appx. 30 min. Until the top was browned and I could stick a toothpick in and not have any batter on it. VERY VERY GOOD."

It set solid after baking-but I will make this again.  I combined 2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, added 1 cup milk &amp; folded in 6 cups sliced (not peeled) fresh peaches.  Put this in a 9X13 glass dish.  Then I made the topping in a saucepan using 2 cups of water, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 Tablespoons butter, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg &amp; 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Brought this to a boil, stirring until sugars dissolved.  Poured over the top.  Baked at 400 for 40-50 minutes."

This is something I&#39;d do also.  Did you make any other alterations other than boiling the liquid a bit? I am anxious to try this, but would like to hear from you first.  Thanks so much. "

I had really sweet South Carolina peaches so I cut the sugar and brown sugar and water in half. Also deleted the nutmeg and cinnamon. We like a lot of crust so next batch plan to double the flour mixture. Easy to make and just a wonderful cobbler. Definitely a keeper!

I also let the liquid boil for a few minutes which I think contributed to thickening.  I like to freeze individual portions.  I was a bit concerned when pouring the liquid on top because it seemed like it was too much, but it worked out well.  I like the way it bakes into a mixture of cake and sauce.  The flavor of nutmeg and cinnamon is wonderful.  I&#39;ve tried many peach cobbler recipes and this will not be my favorite.  Yummy!!"
