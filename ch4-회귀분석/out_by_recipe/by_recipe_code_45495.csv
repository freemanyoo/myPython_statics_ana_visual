I used  Premium Gold whole grain flour with brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat and flax and also 1/2 c oat flour. 1 t. b. soda and 2 t. cream of tartar for leavening. 2T butter and double the vanilla. A few craisins.  1/4 c. brown sugar. Otherwise as directed.  If you ended up with a heavy loaf, try a smaller pan or muffins. My muffins, 5x8 and 3x5&#34; pans all rose nicely and did not fall. Moist but not heavy or Gluey. I am impressed. Nice flavor too. thanks!"

For the past year I’ve been reading recipes on here and reading comments from reviewers on recipes I’d like to try. I find the comments invaluable. I used 5 very ripe medium to large bananas, and I replaced the oil in this recipe with 1/2 cup butter. Added cinnamon and allspice. Doubled the vanilla extract!! I didn’t have applesauce on hand but did have apple butter like another reviewer had suggested. I used one cup Namaste and 1 cup Bob Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flours. The batter was thin enough to pour into my bread pans and it baked perfectly at 55 minutes for me. There is no way you could tell this is gluten free! I like this better than regular banana bread which I’ve found can be dry at times. Not this one!"

I modified it a little in that I add 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of cloves.  I use an &#34;all-in-one&#34; GF product which tends to yield a product which is a bit too heavy and doesn&#39;t rise as well as with regular wheat flour.  The 1/2 tsp of baking powder makes a big difference, and the small amounts of spices bring out the richness of flavor."

I used a coconut flour (Mama&#39;s Coconut blend gluten free flour found at tj maxx) so to complement this I used coconut oil and a few flakes of unsweetened coconut on top with pecans. I had a guest staying at my house that was gluten free but all the other guests said they couldn&#39;t tell the difference and gobbled up the bread then asked to take the muffens home!  I made one loaf and 8 muffins with this recipe.  Fabulous!

My friend sent it me because she wanted to try a GF recipe, so I figured I&#39;d check it out as well. I substituted Olive Oil for Canola Oil because I didn&#39;t have Canola Oil. Also, I used a half cup of sugar, and added chocolate chips. For this recipe, I made muffins instead of a loaf, and for that I baked the muffins for 30 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time for them. The end result was very moist, and delicious muffins. It made 12 muffins (I filled the cups almost to the top, so they were quite full).. I usually cut the sugar on recipes, especially when they call for one cup (it just seems excessive). I considered using honey as a substitute for the sugar, and may try the recipe again doing just that. I think what helps this recipe stay so moist is adding the apple sauce.TL:DR - Recipe was delicious!"

Very difficult to find a gluten free banana bread recipe that creates a very moist, tasty outcome. Easy to make and very flavorful.  I love that it makes two loaves and you don&#39;t need to put butter on the finished product for more moisture.  I would like to try some other alterations like coconut oil, yogurt option, brown sugar or honey, (less sugar) options as healthier choices.  But, it&#39;s a must try recipe.

So I used honey and coconut oil instead of sugar and canola oil.  I also added way more applesauce than is called for.  Banana bread should be more of the consistency of something you can pour out into a baking pan.  Initially the batter was too thick to pour out but as I added applesauce, it became pourable and spreadable.  Otherwise I really like the recipe and I only added walnuts, not chocolate just walnuts and it was refreshingly not too sweet but just right and like I said really moist! Delicious!"

This recipe was so easy and honestly just amazing! My baking time was a bit less than what was recommended (mine were done in about 40min not 45-55min), but wow it knocked my socks off. If you LOVE banana bread and have a gluten allergy (or celiac like myself), you will not feel slighted by this recipe. I used Pamela&#39;s Baking/Pancake (GF) flour and it made this a superb recipe! It&#39;s already a family favorite and will be a recipe I use year after year.  :)"

I had never made gluten free anything, and this turned out so well!  I did make a couple of changes so that didn&#39;t have to use sugar:-I omitted the sugar-I added a generous half cup honey-I added an extra quarter cup GF flour-I added an extra half teaspoon baking soda-I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon salt-I baked it for 40 mins (apparently honey can make stuff burn)- I could have even baked it for 35 mins.It was fantastic!

I changed it a bit with fine results. Here&#39;s what I did: omitted the applesauce and used a tad less sugar, used a tad more flour(maybe a few extra tablespoons because I did not measure flour exactly), used softened butter instead of oil and baked the batter in one larger glass loaf pan instead of two smaller ones. I used whole walnuts, not chopped walnuts. Toward the end of baking (last 20 minutes) I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees. This came out the best so far out of all the gluten free recipes for banana bread I have tried.   I also used a homemade recipe for gluten free flour that contains the following:  white rice flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, pectin and xanthan gum.  The raw batter was thick going into the pan.  Once the butter and sugar were  creamed, I basically dumped everything else in including whole peeled bananas, and whipped it all up in my kitchen aid mixer for less than a minute.  I liked the sprinkled nuts on top(which I did not measure) as opposed to mixing them into the batter. I just made sure the top of the batter was covered nicely with walnuts.  The nuts get nice and toasted and it looks good, too!   By the way, there is no milk in this recipe.   Perhaps leaving out the applesauce is why the batter was not soupy.  I like to alter recipes when I don&#39;t have all the ingredients on hand.   I also like this recipe because it uses a lot of ripe bananas, which I had plenty of today  : )"

I used 3/4 organic sugar and sweetened applesause.  I used 4 very ripe bananas and mixed in the nuts.  I baked the two loaves at 375 convection bake.  It came out  great.  Moist, very light in texture.  I think  you could use any gluten free flour and by adding the xanthium gum you will have a good result."

It was EXTREMELY dense.  So dense in fact that it was raw and runny in the middle and almost burnt on the outside after an hour in the oven.  I have no clue what i did wrong.  I got it to the point of edible in the middle.  I even made a test batch and added more flower because that was slightly too wet.  I think it would do best as two small loaves.  It had a great flavor though and the outside is wonderful.  I need help to make this right!!"

I varied the recipe just a bit - I used 1 1/2 c GF all purpose flour and 1/2 c gf sorghum flour.  I also used frozen mashed over-ripe bananas.  They are very juicy and this allowed me to eliminate the canola oil.  Next time I will add some chocolate chips as an extra treat.

This was my first recipe and it&#39;s definitely a winner!  The first time I made it I used 5 bananas and it wasmore traditional in texture. In place of sugar I used Sun Crystal which is being discontinued... So next I&#39;m going to try &#34;Just Like Sugar&#34; which is made from chicory root. It has no calories or sugar effect at all. It is completely natural with a very slight orange aftertaste from the white part of the rind that is used in the product. It&#39;s not as sweet as sugar but has a similar consistency. You can google it online. I&#39;ve been trying to find a product similar to sugar so I could convert recipes more easily. This is a great recipe and freezes well too!

I followed another cook&#39;s suggestions and added in an additional 1/2 C. of GF flour.  So I used 2 C. of a finely ground brown rice mix that I use for most of my recipes and then an additional 1/2 C. of sorghum flour, which bakes like a dream in GF baked goodies.  I also made another &#39;applesauce&#39; version where I subbed in applesauce for the bananas, and then used Greek yogurt in place of the original 1/2 C. of applesauce.  It produced the same great texture and wonderful, light taste.  And for sugar in both recipes, I used 1/2 C. raw cane sugar, which is brown and tastes like brown sugar, and then 1/3 C. agave nectar, the dark amber kind.  It was perfectly sweet but not too heavy."

One following the recipe, and one with an extra 1/2 cup of GF flour.  They both tasted the same, the difference being the size and density of the loaf.  The one with extra flour turned out like a traditional loaf of banana bread, while the one following the recipe turned out more dense and flatter.  Both batches didn&#39;t last more than a day in my house.  :-)"
