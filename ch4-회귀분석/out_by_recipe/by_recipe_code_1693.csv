Everyone that I have served it to raved about this cake. I use my favorite Lavazza coffee for the brewed coffee. I substitute canned evaporated milk for the whole milk. My favorite frosting is a peanut butter frosting and I use it with this cake. I put a few piped swirls of frosting on top and top each swirl with a Reeses peanut butter cup.

Everyone loved it, moist and really quick to put together.  The icing is excellent as well.  Not to sweet.

The leftover cake is now 3 days old and just as delicious as the first day.  I bake the cake a day ahead and iced in the morning.  This will be my go to chocolate layer cake."

I’ve doubled it before when making my kids multi-layered, multi-shaped birthday cakes. Everyone always complements it!! I have made the frosting listed in the recipe, but have made other “favorite” frostings instead, too, mostly because I don’t use shortening. I use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly. Someone said the center comes out raw....the recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is. However, it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time. I typically average a few extra minutes and it’s perfect!!! It also does freeze great, without frosting. When I’m making shaped birthday cakes, I freeze my cut-off extra pieces as I’m layering and then take them out for a later day. Sometimes, I frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving, but not always. They’re great without it too."

You cook the flour and milk stirring constantly so there is no lumps and bring it to a boil.  Then take it off the stove to cool down put in fridge until cold.

I&#39;ve tied many, many chocolate cake recipes and none can compare to this one.  As a bonus, it&#39;s outrageously easy!  I&#39;ve even baked this in heart-shaped layers and decorated it with rolled fondant (after icing, of course) and fondant roses for a Valentine&#39;s treat - its texture is substantial enough to hold up to the fondant.We like this cake best chilled.  My husband and I call it &#34;Whoopie Pie Cake&#34; as we are from Maine, and think that it really captures the flavor of those yummy Maine treats.Personally I usually do bake it at 350, as I&#39;ve found that at 325 it takes rather a lot longer than 30 minutes, but that may be my oven.  At any rate, this is an absolute &#34;keeper&#34; recipe!"

This cake was a disaster for me today.  I used 9-inch pans and the cake came out over the top and spilled into the oven.   I followed the recipe to the letter, but I think it should have been baked at 350 degrees rather than 325 and perhaps part of the batter should have been used for cupcakes as described if one used the 8-inch pans!  Too much batter for 9-inch pans."

I did add 1 cup powdered sugar to sweeten the frosting like another person did.  And I baked 2 -8 inch and 6 cupcakes.  My cakes ran over the sides of the pans.  Next time I &#39;ll do 9 inch and cupcakes.  Very Yummy!

I have shared it with everyone that has asked for a Moist Chocolate Cake. And the Icing Recipe that is with this cake is Excellent! It is NOT sweet at all. You can actually eat the whole piece of cake without scraping the icing off due to heavy sweetness. I truely believe that every cook out there should have a copy of this recipe for it is the BEST.Barb Smith
