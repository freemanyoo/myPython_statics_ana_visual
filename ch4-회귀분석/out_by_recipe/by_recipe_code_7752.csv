Just a thought. I will be trying this one!! ??"

It is a little putzy, but it&#39;s not difficult by any means.  I couldn&#39;t find regular caramels, so I used caramel bits and didn&#39;t have any difficulty with oozing like others have commented.  The only bad thing is that trying to cut the candy is like trying to cut a brick with a pair of scissors.....  Also, if the candy gets too soft, despite how hard it is to cut, the top layer with come off, so I&#39;d place it back in the fridge halfway through cutting and then cut again.  Despite the effort, I&#39;ll definitely be making this again."

It’s true that it tastes like a Snickers bar, only way better! I have no trouble with the candy falling apart, contrary to what some of the other reviewers have stated. Cutting into the chocolate with a warm, sharp knife will help make the cutting easier. I also add less heavy cream (almost by half) when melting the caramels. I followed other reviewers’ advice on that and it did prevent the caramel from oozing between the layers. Also, in the past, I’ve placed the pan in my freezer to help speed up the hardening process of the different recipes. This candy is especially great when made around Christmas time."

I couldn&#39;t cook it for 5 minutes. After 4 minutes it became very gritty and I couldn&#39;t use. I threw the filling out and started over and cooked for less time. I did add 2 tablespoons of honey for all layers that called for peanut butter. I always use honey in all peanut butter recipes. I also use a square cake pan  8 x 8 for the candy. I like my candy thicker with smaller squares when served.

It is delicious and reminds me of one of my favorite candy bars.  A hint for those who are having problems with the chocolate topping cracking when trying to cut into squares.  Take the pan from the refrigerator and let it sit on your counter until the chocolate warms up a little.  The caramel will also soften some and be easier to cut.  It is a winner!

However, like some of the other reviews, I too had a problem with the top icing layer cracking and breaking to pieces when I cut it,  and it didn&#39;t stick to the caramel layer under it. I was dissapointed by that happening and wondered if anyone has a solution to keeping the top icing layer from breaking into many pieces and not sticking to the caramel layer? I followed the directions completely and also followed what the reviewer, spoir10692 wrote on December 22, 2010 to keep the top icing layer from spliting/cracking, and it still didn&#39;t work. I also had a problem of cutting it into nice square pieces since the caramel layer was hard to cut through and it came out in jagged edges. It didn&#39;t look like the evenly cut pieces in the picture at all and I found it took me a long time to made it.  Well, after all this, I still will keep trying to make this turn out right since it was SO delicious and adictive!"

Easy to make, although they take time because of the need to let them harden between layers.  Had no problems with the icing cracking or the caramel running.  We kept them in the refrigerator or freezer until about a half an hour before serving.  To store, I buttered the bottom of a pyrex container lightly, made one layer with the candies, then put parchment paper down and made another layer on top.  Between chilling them and the parchment paper, it kept them from sticking together too much."

I figured I would be creative and made it in individual paper cups.  This was NOT a good way to go. While it taste just as good, it took a lot of extra time.  Save yourself the headache and simply make it in a 9X13 pan as the recipe calls for.  After cutting them into squares they can easily be placed in mini paper cups for easy serving so they don&#39;t stick together.  The nougat filling is to die for all by itself!

What I did was I let the final icing layer set at room temp for several hours prior to putting it in the fridge. I let it set overnight and then when I took it out I let it get to room temp (approx 1 hour) then cut with a paring knife.  The caramel did not run either.

As for the chocolate cracking-not quite sure what you all did. My only problem I had was I did not have a  13 X 9 pan - mine was 18 X 12.  I just used 1/2 of the pan-it was thin but still a HIT! No cracked chocolate- I used giaradelli (sp) milk chocolate. Had that on hand. Plus it was cheaper than nestles at the time.

However, the icing didn&#39;t work well for me.  While cooking, it became very thick and wouldn&#39;t spread.  So I added a tablespoon of butter to thin it out.  It spread very well.  I let it set in the refridgerator and did as the instructions said and let it set out for 20 minutes before cutting.  The icing fell into a million pieces.  So I&#39;m not sure what else I could do.  But it is very delicious as is with or without icing and I would make it again."
