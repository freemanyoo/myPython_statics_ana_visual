I think next time I&#39;d go a little lighter on the cheese, add some extra zucchini/squash, and play around with some spices or a little more imaginative of a sauce. Also, I&#39;m having difficulty understanding where the similarity to Pizza is imagined to be.

All that said, I liked it. Plus, as a concept (i.e. Squash/egg/cheese based) it&#39;s a great way to use up the tons of summer squash from the garden."

Basil, oregano. Garlic, salt and black pepper. A can of paste added to the sauce. Simmer until it bubbles like the old mud pots at Disneyland.

Not only that, he&#39;s been requesting it at least once a week since I discovered it on your site a few months ago.  Getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge, but we started using a hand-held ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time.  It makes a huge difference, and I find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well.  I toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor, and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce (ground chicken, turkey, beef . . . even elk!) and it has come out fantastic every time.

I am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except for...then lists a long list of modifications. Well, I made some changes, too, and the outcome was great. I followed the process instructions as written. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef as I wanted a little zippier flavor, more pizza-like. I also added 1 tsp. of minced garlic after the sausage-onion mixture was browned (who doesn&#39;t like a little garlic in pizza?) My grocery store did not have Italian tomato sauce so I used regular and added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. Since the recipe called for either red or green pepper, I used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper, giving the dish a colorful look. My husband was a bit skeptical until the first bite--then he was a convert. He raved about it and I do have to say, it was delicious. I  had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bake-one-freeze-one. I&#39;ll have to see how that goes next time I make it because we&#39;ve plowed right into the next casserole the next night; leftovers were as delicious as the first night. I have strict instructions to make this dish again. ;)"

May take a couple times, but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper.  Also, my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we don&#39;t use beef or sausage - just spread pizza sauce over crust, put a think layer of pepperoni on this, then your cheeses and veggies.  Sometimes bacon with the pepperoni (WHY NOT?!?!)  After it&#39;s done everyone puts their own toppings on as desired.  They love to help make it, too, so are happy to eat it :)"

I loved the zucchini crust.  It was such a nice change of pace to a heavy bread crust.  The only changes I made were based on using ingredients on hand - used an Italian cheese blend for the mozzarella and a colby-jack blend for the cheddar because I had both of those.  I love a dish that is versatile in that way so just use whatever cheese combo you like best on this dish and you should have a winner.  Also, I took the advice of others and cooked the bell pepper with the beef and onions because my family prefers that combo.  My skeptical pizza loving daughter ate this and said it was good.  I will definitely be making this dish again."

This time, I made it in the morning, as (1) it doesn&#39;t heat the house up quite as much earlier in the day, and (2) we both think it tastes better after it sits awhile. I generally avoid cheesy-meaty dishes during the hotter months, but this one doesn&#39;t come off as heavy because of the zucchini &#34;crust&#34;.

I didn&#39;t use salt, but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour.  Then squeezed it through paper towels.  I really wanted a firm crust so baked it for 25 minutes rather than 20.  That timing was absolutely perfect; the edges were just starting to brown.  I added garlic, red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce, and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking.  The ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than I had expected, and the zucchinie was less.  This is a great casserole in which to &#34;hide&#34; vegetables.  We&#39;d love to try it with Italian sausage instead of the ground beef, but unfortunately that would raise the fat content through the roof.  All and all, a yummy recipe."

It turned out wonderful!!!It is definitely a keeper.  My husband and toddler both loved it.   The only thing I did different was sauteed my onion and green pepper and then cooked my meat and used my favorite spaghetti sauce.  It was absolutely delicious!
