Don&#39;t waste your time measuring the mashed bananas; I&#39;ve found three bananas works every time--and I dump the rest of the ingredients with the mashed bananas and give the beaters a few spins to mix it all together.  Because the &#34;cake&#34; is sweet enough as is, I never add the frosting, and it&#39;s never missed.  This is a no-fail, moist every time, always praised recipe.  A professional wedding cake baker asked me for this recipe because she was going to replace hers for this one.  You will not be disappointed."

I made it for dinner last night and the only adjustments I made were to add white wine to produce more sauce but it was still far too dry and to top the pasta with the shrimp mixture before broiling  We also thought it was very bland; with the amount of garlic and lemon juice we thought it would taste better.  I&#39;ve been thinking about how to improve it: add lemon zest?  saute the shrimp in the butter/oil instead of simmering in the liquid?  I&#39;ve decided to use other shrimp scampi recipes instead.  The crispy broiled topping was wonderful so will try that with another recipe."

We had a house-full of people, so it makes enough. I will be bringing this to pot-lucks, for sure.  It certainly was NOT bland.  We used freshly picked rhubarb. We all loved the shortbread crust. I feel this was an easy recipe and quick, but then, I had my rhubarb already cut and didn&#39;t bake the crust before adding the filling. It tastes more custardy when eaten warm.

The crust could have baked about 3-4 minutes longer but that may have been my oven. I took this to a potluck without having made the recipe before; that&#39;s always a gamble! I received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe. Tell-tale vote was in the fact that I took home an empty pan! The bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting. I also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used. It gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would.

I will definitely be making this one again. I put it in a graham cracker crust, and it was off the wall. I do, however have a couple tips to the people who claim the pie was too runny or eggy. When mixing the cheese filling, make sure you beat it smooth as the instructions say. It may take quite a bit of doing, considering you are dealing with cream cheese, especially if it isnt softened completely. Make sure there are no chunks left and that it is nice and whipped. The same goes for the caramel topping. I also only used 2 and a half eggs instead of 3 in the topping mixture. let the pecans swim, but dont drown them. I didnt completely use the entire topping mixture on mine. Finally, make sure your cheesecake is completely baked to the middle, and make sure you cool and refridge the pie for the proper amount of time."

The only change I made was that I substituted homemade brown sugar caramel for the store bought topping. Its the &#34;easy caramel sauce&#34; on the Pioneer Woman site, and it literally only takes five minutes to make.  Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before letting it touch the eggs, and keep it a little on the runny side - it will thicken a bit as it comes to room temperature, and you don&#39;t want it too thick when you mix it with the eggs.  The pie was great - a perfect blend of several wonderful tastes and textures.  I give it five stars."

Made it for friends and they loved it! I didn&#39;t use a deep dish pie crust, I used a graham cracker pie crust because its my fav with cheesecake, and pecan pie. Because I didn&#39;t use a deep dish pie crust I used less caramel than the recipe called for, maybe 2/3 of it was used. My pie still came out like the pic and maybe even better! The one problem I did have with the recipe is the timing to leave the pie in the oven. The recipe stated 35mins. But my pie was still not done in the middle so I left it for an additional 15 mins. or so and it came out perfect with the golden brown crust. YUMMY!!"

I wasn&#39;t sure what you meant by topping either, sounds like a cheaper brand of topping and not syrup will have the caramel sink to the bottom.  I kind of have  an issue with TOH in general, in that this takes way more than 30 minutes to make.  In general, your recipes, all the ingredients are prepared - pecans chopped, cream cheese softened and then you start the timer, I wish you would put your times in as if starting from scratch.

I love the sage in it. I feel it sets it apart. If you are worried about the salt use a salt free broth- Walmart sells one.  I alternate corn and flour tortillas - every other one. I feel if they are all corn they are too mushy and all flour to gummy. Every other is just right. This is hands down a recipe that people ask me for over and over again.

I also added a bit of brown sugar to cut the salt and acidity. Next time I would half the amount of salt. On its own it was WAY too salty. Thankfully the toppings masked the saltiness.

But my husband and I really did like this a lot. My teenage boys thought it was fine but they don&#39;t like Mexican food that much. I used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section. Traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has WAY too much salt. I also didn&#39;t add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested. The salt flavor was perfect. My husband also bought the HUGE tortillas so I still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla. I used 7 tortillas but they I cut about 1/3 off of them. I put in a little over 1/2 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top. We loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top. I wish I put avocado on top too. The flavor was great. There was a ton of sauce and we love sauce. Great meal.

It is fusion cooking. This is Tex-Mex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional Mexican food made to please those North of the border.  Here, in Texas, people put beef in just about everything.  We always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladas.Traditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author noted.The sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products.  I can tell you with authority that most restaurants and Mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce.   California, Northern and Central Mexico don&#39;t use tomatoes in this way traditionally.As we live in Texas, I encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional Mexican food.  Some are o.k. but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation.   The same is true with many Mexican families here.For my enchilada sauce I only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent, then I add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least 4 minutes.   I then add the broth (Better Than Bouillon Chicken) and simmer for 30 minutes.  I don&#39;t add salt as there is enough in the broth.

Sometimes I add rice to the meat...I&#39;ve even added sweet corn &amp; black beans a few times.  I left out the sage for years, just because I never cooked with it.

Everyone- even my picky eater- loved it. My only complaint is that it was way too salty and I did not even add all the salt called for and I also used low sodium beef broth. So my suggestion is to completely omit the salt. I also think this would be great with shredded chicken or beef, and with other things added to the filling like rice, beans or pickled jalapenos. I had enough filling for 13 of the 6 inch tacos. I bet you could also use corn tortillas instead of flour if you wish. Over all this was amazing and I will definitely make it again!

I used corn tortillas for myself to make it gluten-free.  I found I had to dip/brush sauce on both sides to keep them from breaking.  I left out the flour in the filling and used 1/4 cup cornstarch in place of the flour in the sauce to make it GF.  I just added the cornstarch to the broth.  I think this would taste good with beans, either in the filling or on the side.  Next time I might try reducing the butter.  Has anyone tried that?"

Next, there are a few speedboats you hit while making. For example, the batter is VERY thick. Honestly, it&#39;s more the consistency of cookie dough. Dont try to use a hand mixer on this, it will break (been there, done that). The reason for that, though, is all the liquid that is in the apples will cook out and mix with the batter while baking. It&#39;s supposed to be like that.

Next, it is VERY sweet if you use anything other than a tart apple; I always go straight for the big granny smiths. Anything else just adds together to make a sugary overload.

Last, the end result is a very moist, very heavy cake. Best if eaten quickly, even better if warm. It will not last more than a couple of days!

Pairs beautifully with some vanilla ice-cream, cinnamon, and caramel (never actually used the butterscotch sauce part of the recipe, never felt it was the right kind of flavor). Makes for a fantastic breakfast or dessert, and it&#39;s perfect for those cool autumn nights and brisk winter mornings."

It easily spread into the pan.  I wanted to taste more apple, so cut the nutmeg in half.  It was perfect.  You can still taste the nutmeg, but it&#39;s not overpowering.

I wouldn&#39;t change a thing, except that with my oven I needed about 10 minutes more baking time. Oh, and I used 4 different types of apples (Granny Smith, jazz, pink lady, and braeburn). As others have stated, the batter was indeed quite stiff, but my little Sunbeam mixer could still handle it. When it was time to stir in the apples, the fruit-to-batter ratio was very high; no wonder this cake is so incredibly moist! Speaking of which?don?t worry if the surface of your cake is hard and crusty when it comes out of the oven. After it?s mostly cooled, cover it with foil and it will resolve itself shortly to become uniformly moist and tender. As with most cakes, it&#39;s better the second day. I think the cake stands on its own without the sauce, but that punch of sweetness is a nice treat. I added a few drops of butter-rum extract, just for fun. I will make this sauce again for other things (ice cream, or a dip for apples, for example). Five stars!"

I used Newtown Pippin apples...great chunky flavor!  I, too, had to bake the cake an extra 5 minutes each time I&#39;ve made it.  The top doesn&#39;t spring back, so I look for a golden-brown top instead.  The sauce is nice but not necessary.  (I took the advice of another reviewer and used butterscotch topping instead.)  This cake is fine served at any temperature.  This cake is a contest winner for sure!"

I have to add the I didn&#39;t make the sauce and it was sweet enough without it. My boyfriend doesn&#39;t eat sweets and thinks its too sweet but I can&#39;t stop eating it.

I made it on top of the stove instead of in the crock pot and let it simmer for about and hour to blend the flavors.  I had about 3/4 of a can of pumpkin left over from a coffee cake I had made last weekend and it worked out fine.  I used lower sodium chicken broth and black beans and it was still salty enough for us.  I also substituted a can of mild diced tomatoes with chiles for the regular diced tomatoes.  I noticed one reader said that the recipe turned out too soupy.  Try taking the lid off and cooking it on high a little longer in the crick pot or simmering it with the lid off for a few minutes on top of the stove.  My husband and son both rated this a 5.

In fairness, the recipe states after you uncover the potatoes that the cooking time will be 30 - 40 minutes or longer if your potatoes aren&#39;t tender.

<ol><li>I skipped the butter the second time, instead bringing the milk to a simmer and adding the flour to thicken it. When I used the butter, I got quite a bit of excess grease sitting in the corners of the pan. I know butter is a key component of a béchamel sauce, which is the base of this dish, but you&#39;re adding enough cheese that you don&#39;t need the richness butter provides, and if it cooks out and forms a layer of grease it&#39;s not adding to the recipe anyway.</li><li>1/8 tsp of black pepper is an insultingly small amount for a recipe this large. If you use that little pepper in your cooking, please never invite me to dinner. I know the recipe says &#34;additional pepper optional,&#34; but it really isn&#39;t. This recipe makes 8 servings. 1/64th of a teaspoon per serving might as well be nothing.</li></ol>"

First, it is yet anoth recipe for a family of six; I&#39;m retired and ofteen cook for myself alone (my wife prefers other things).  So, down to one really big Russet potato put through the mandolin at an eighth-inch setting, then cut into smaller pieces.  Second, the sauce as described (and then scale down) is too thick; I found myself addding more ½&amp;½ (more cream flavor, and not so fatty as heavy cream).  Third, cheddar is nice, but I also threw in some store-bought 4-cheese pizza cheese.  I also used some on top during the uncovered baking time -- nice lightly browned top.  Fourth, Imade this a one-dish meal: a layer of sauce, a layer of potato + a bit more sauce and a layer of sliced baked ham + a bit more sauce, another layer of potatoes and the rest of the sauce.  The baking instructions (adjusted a bit for a convection oven) were spot on; the covered cooking time; I added the extra chees on top, then did the uncovered baking time (again, adjusted downward for a convection oven).  A quick (and gentle) stire after a short time sitting just after coming out, brought the sauce together neatly and the result was very satisfactory."

To get it right,  you must cook the dish at lower temperature for a longer duration. I found starting at 400 for 40 minutes and then dropping the temp to 300 in a convection oven for 90 minutes to be successful.  The cheese bechamel is still holding and the potatoes are cooked as far as I can tell using a toothpick to test the softness. Feel free to add your own touches to make this dish your own. Overall an kk recipe but it needs work to turnout properly."

I think people that have included in their review that the potatoes were not cooked enough did not interpret the recipe correctly.  I believe the recipe could be more clearly written that after you cook covered for 1 hour, you THEN remove the cover and cook for an ADDITIONAL 30-40 minutes.  That is plenty of time-- the potatoes were quite soft.  You DEFINITELY do NOT need to precook the potatoes first.  That is a waste of every working person&#39;s limited time.  Do be aware that you need to set aside AT LEAST TWO HOURS of time to prepare, cook, and cool this dish.   I liked it a lot but would add a bit more than the 1 cup of cheese the next time."

It looked nothing like the photo which should have been my first clue when I saw what looked like an omelet under  the chicken.  Usually you do egg then flour so I dont know if this was the problem or if it was suppose to be like this.  Too much basil and garlic for 1/4 c of bread crumbs. Wont be trying this one anymore.

The &#34;bruschetta&#34; on top was just garlicky tomatoes.  Definitely deleting this one from the &#34;recipes to try&#34; file!"

Are you using butter with your crumbs-most margarines today contain water which could be causing the soggy problem. Also, you are leaving the foil loose, right so that cooking is aided, but steam escapes? I&#39;m going to try dipping the breast halves in skim milk and then in panko crumbs to see how that turns out. (Panko crumbs are coarser, crisper bread crumbs that allow you to bake things with a crispy coating without frying. It is a newer product here in the US)"

The only tweaks I made to it are: - No Carrots:  They make the soup too sweet. - Cheese:  I prefer using real cheese like medium cheddar or colby rather than the Velveeta. It melts fast if you shred it. On occasion I&#39;ll use 1/2 (or less) of the Velveeta and substitute the other half  with actual cheddar or colby. Real cheese will always taste better. - On occasion I&#39;ll use broccoli instead of potatoes - viola you have broccoli cheese soup!

I definitely recommend doubling the recipe if you are making this for a family, so you can enjoy leftovers! The few changes I made: I used Sargento sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed. There was no graininess in the texture, which sometimes can happen with pre-shredded cheese. I am not an expert cook by any means, but I was a little thrown off by the milk/flour mixture. I am used to making a roux, so that is what I did instead. To the roux, I added half and half (instead of milk) and the cheese. I then poured this mixture into the pot with the veggies/broth. I didn&#39;t think this recipe needed any salt, so I didn&#39;t add any. I topped each bowl with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and some green onions. So, so, good!"

Once they&#39;re crispy they&#39;re much easier to cut. Also I don&#39;t recommend the flour step, so far all potato soup I&#39;ve made has had the perfect consistency with just the potatoes getting a little mashed and the cheese doing its own thing.Also as others suggested, I recommend cutting the cheese back a touch. Velveeta is already very thick and provides a lot of its own unique flavor. I went majority cheddar cheese and about a five ounce block of velveeta.And, as a presence, I added some green onion into the soup verses on top."

We used the remaining to crumble into our bowls.  I sauted the onions and carrots in about a tbs of bacon drippings before I added the potatoes and broth.  I used celery seed because I did not have fresh celery, but I plan to use fresh celery next time.  Also, to increase volume,  used 4 cups and milk and a little more than 4 tbs. flour.  My husband likes his soup a little thick.  This recipe is very versatile.  I am already planning when I can make this again, and maybe use ham instead of bacon.

I researched many different recipes before finding this one and I will look no more. I made some changes but am sure the original recipe is just as good. I reserved a few tablespoons of bacon grease and sauteed finely chopped onion, garlic and three celery stalks until tender.  I used reduced sodium broth and bacon and increased amount of salt to 1 rounded tsp.    I also reserved some of the bacon for garnish with shredded cheese.  I used 1 can evaporated milk and half-half to equal 2 cups and then used 1 cup 1% milk to equal the 3 cups recipe calls for.  I  purchased cream of potato in case i needed to thicken but no thickening needed.  It was so creamy and literally &#34;hugged&#34; the spoon, I think the evaporated milk helped. Next time I will add another cup of potatoes. Thanks so much for the recipe!"

This soup was excellent! I did make a few changes. First, I doubled the recipe to make a nice size pot. I omitted the celery seed as DH does not like it, but I minced a small rib of celery and cooked it with the potatoes and other veggies. Instead of doubling the parsley flakes, I added 1Tbsp. dried parsley flakes and 1 Tbsp dried minced chives. I added equal amounts of melted margarine with the flour in a separate pot, then added the milk and cheese to make a cheese sauce. Once that was all thickened and cheesy, I added it to the potato/veggie mixture. It was great, and I will make it again!"

I used 5 very ripe medium to large bananas, and I replaced the oil in this recipe with 1/2 cup butter. Added cinnamon and allspice. Doubled the vanilla extract!! I didn’t have applesauce on hand but did have apple butter like another reviewer had suggested. I used one cup Namaste and 1 cup Bob Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flours.

My friend sent it me because she wanted to try a GF recipe, so I figured I&#39;d check it out as well. I substituted Olive Oil for Canola Oil because I didn&#39;t have Canola Oil. Also, I used a half cup of sugar, and added chocolate chips. For this recipe, I made muffins instead of a loaf, and for that I baked the muffins for 30 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time for them. The end result was very moist, and delicious muffins. It made 12 muffins (I filled the cups almost to the top, so they were quite full).. I usually cut the sugar on recipes, especially when they call for one cup (it just seems excessive). I considered using honey as a substitute for the sugar, and may try the recipe again doing just that. I think what helps this recipe stay so moist is adding the apple sauce.TL:DR - Recipe was delicious!"

So I used honey and coconut oil instead of sugar and canola oil.  I also added way more applesauce than is called for.  Banana bread should be more of the consistency of something you can pour out into a baking pan.  Initially the batter was too thick to pour out but as I added applesauce, it became pourable and spreadable.  Otherwise I really like the recipe and I only added walnuts, not chocolate just walnuts and it was refreshingly not too sweet but just right and like I said really moist! Delicious!"

I changed it a bit with fine results. Here&#39;s what I did: omitted the applesauce and used a tad less sugar, used a tad more flour(maybe a few extra tablespoons because I did not measure flour exactly), used softened butter instead of oil and baked the batter in one larger glass loaf pan instead of two smaller ones. I used whole walnuts, not chopped walnuts. Toward the end of baking (last 20 minutes) I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees. This came out the best so far out of all the gluten free recipes for banana bread I have tried.   I also used a homemade recipe for gluten free flour that contains the following:  white rice flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, pectin and xanthan gum.  The raw batter was thick going into the pan.  Once the butter and sugar were  creamed, I basically dumped everything else in including whole peeled bananas, and whipped it all up in my kitchen aid mixer for less than a minute.  I liked the sprinkled nuts on top(which I did not measure) as opposed to mixing them into the batter. I just made sure the top of the batter was covered nicely with walnuts.  The nuts get nice and toasted and it looks good, too!   By the way, there is no milk in this recipe.   Perhaps leaving out the applesauce is why the batter was not soupy.  I like to alter recipes when I don&#39;t have all the ingredients on hand.   I also like this recipe because it uses a lot of ripe bananas, which I had plenty of today  : )"

This was my first recipe and it&#39;s definitely a winner!  The first time I made it I used 5 bananas and it wasmore traditional in texture. In place of sugar I used Sun Crystal which is being discontinued... So next I&#39;m going to try &#34;Just Like Sugar&#34; which is made from chicory root. It has no calories or sugar effect at all. It is completely natural with a very slight orange aftertaste from the white part of the rind that is used in the product. It&#39;s not as sweet as sugar but has a similar consistency. You can google it online. I&#39;ve been trying to find a product similar to sugar so I could convert recipes more easily. This is a great recipe and freezes well too!

I followed another cook&#39;s suggestions and added in an additional 1/2 C. of GF flour.  So I used 2 C. of a finely ground brown rice mix that I use for most of my recipes and then an additional 1/2 C. of sorghum flour, which bakes like a dream in GF baked goodies.  I also made another &#39;applesauce&#39; version where I subbed in applesauce for the bananas, and then used Greek yogurt in place of the original 1/2 C. of applesauce.  It produced the same great texture and wonderful, light taste.  And for sugar in both recipes, I used 1/2 C. raw cane sugar, which is brown and tastes like brown sugar, and then 1/3 C. agave nectar, the dark amber kind.  It was perfectly sweet but not too heavy."

Tips: Make sure all your liquid/wet ingredients are at room temperature. I microwaved the milk to warm it up so that the melted butter wouldn&#39;t solidify once it was added to cold milk. For the eggs, I soaked them in hot water to bring them to room temperature then very lightly scrambled them before combining with the milk and butter. Sift the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients. Mix until combined but be careful not to overmix."

You must have beaten the batter way too much.  When using baking powder you are not suppose to overbeat/mix.  sounds like that was your problem.  The baking powder is what makes them so fluffy.  Also, you need to use a small fine mesh strainer to put the baking power through.  This will break up any clumps of powder.  Otherwise you will have small pockets of baking powder that taste horrible.  Give it another try (do a half recipe) you&#39;ll be surprised."

I did not have the 5-spice or the red pepper flakes but substituted some chili power and extra black pepper and it was still great.  We dont like really spicy foods so next time I may add 1/2 the red papper flakes or a dash of the 5-spice if I can find it to see if that changes anything.

Just a little twist from this recepi.Use lime juice (2tblspoon) instead of orange juice. Ommit tomato sauce.  Substitude with tamarind juice (2tblspoon) if you did not use lime juice at all. Before you fry the chicken with corn oil, oat it with 1teaspoon of tumeric powder 1teaspoon of salt. When chicken is done, scoop out the chicken. Use the same oil to cook the sauce. Remember to season the sauce with salt &amp; sugar (up to you). Put the chicken into the sauce and stir a while. The sauce should be sweet &amp; spicy. There are many version of Asian style.

Stores I purchased from (eastern US) Harris Teeter, Whole Foods, Kroger, and oriental market stores.  Brands were McCormick (recent), W-F&#39;s 365, Badia &amp; Goya in the Hispanic section.  It&#39;s a better buy in the oriental and Hispanic sections.  Also, the ingredients vary slightly, so read them an choose according to your personal tastes.Hope this helps!"

They are so good. I baked mine in a 15 x 10 pan per the recipe, and had to make extra frosting, as there was not enough to cover the top (even with a very thing layer). 6 oz. of cream cheese is a strange amount. I used the whole 8 oz. brick, and added the proportion of powdered sugar and milk needed to finish topping the bars. I wonder if there&#39;s a typo in the recipe? Should it be 6 oz. of cream cheese, or should it have been 16 oz? Would have been plenty of frosting (maybe too much) for a 9x13 using 6 oz, but not enough for the 15x10."

I also substituted half of the oil with applesauce and added 1/2 teaspoon  of ginger. 1/4 tsp of clove and 1/8 of nutmeg . I made the icing exactly to the recipe. 4 solid stars as a cake but I think it would be 5 as a bar. I will make again.

Instead of sugar I have use Truvia cane sugar blend which only requires 1/2 the amount of sugar and has 75% fewer calories than regular sugar.  I also used 3 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as suggested in other reviews plus an extra sprinkle or two.  When I make this in a 11X15 pan I make a recipe and a half so  they do not come out thin.  Or I use a 9 X13 pan and bake for 30 - 35 minutes.   Instead of cream cheese frosting I just use a can of coconut pecan frosting instead.

I make something similar using three jars of baby food carrots in place of pumpkin (and 1/4 cup more oil) and they are to die for! (They are probably a brighter orange than pumpkin bars) I bake them in a sheet cake pan, which makes them more like bars. I also use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter in the icing, sticking to the 2 cups of sugar,  which means that they would be slightly less sweet. The frosting just covers them.To the person who asked about a substitute for cannola oil, you can use any kind of oil except for olive. My favorite is safflower oil, but I warn you that it is expensive. I love it in salad dressings and have used it in my carrot bars. It is very light.."

If you use a 15x10 pan it&#39;s a bar andmight want to check prior to the bake time stated.  9x13 pan is a cake&amp; will take longer to bake since it&#39;s thicker. Remember you shouldonly take bake times stated as a estimate of time needed. Rule ofthumb... EVERY OVEN IS DIFFERENT....AND TOOTH PICKS NEVER LIE.Always check it a little earlier then time called for- say 5 to 8 minutes.And lastly think about what ratio is called for in a recipe before youstart mixing it.

The toothpick came out clean but the bars actually had a gummy texture. I should try the recipe again as the original recipe reads but honestly I don&#39;t like any recipe with that much oil.  I also tried chocolate chips sprinkled on top of half of the bars (a jelly roll pan makes a lot of bars so I wanted to try them different way).  It was a bad idea. The bars did not have that choc chip pumpkin muffin sense at all. I do agree with many others that the recipe was super easy to put together. At least I have something good to add.

Had leftover porkroast and gravy,so used it instead of hamburger and boullion.  Used hashbrown potatoes, put half in at beginning and saved rest t heat thru at end so they held their shape, the early ones helped thicken the soup, added some frozen corn and made it like chowder, which my hubby loves. Use 1% milk. 2% mex. blend cheese.  required no flour. i used no velveeta. It&#39;s bad for u,  did use a bit of Hormel real bacon bits on top. It s so good.

While that was nhappening I made a roux out of butter (I used 4 T instead of the 2) and flour, milk, melted in the cheese.

In the 13 years I&#39;ve been married, my husband has never eaten banana bread. However, when I had him try this, he was shocked at how good it was. Everytime I turn around, he&#39;s getting another slice. The kids absolutely love it and I swear it&#39;s the best thing I&#39;ve made in years. Throwing away the other banana bread recipes because none of them compare. We leave out the nuts, but it doesn&#39;t take away from the end result.

I needed to make it gluten-free, so I used only GF &#34;graham&#34; crumbs, increasing the amount to total both kinds of crumbs. Instead of hot fudge topping stirred into the chocolate layer, I melted dark chocolate into some milk and stirred it into 1/3 of the batter. I left 1/3 plain, and I stirred the peanut butter into the other 1/3. I layered them in the pan, chocolate on bottom, plain in the middle, and PB on top. I baked it about an hour and 10 minutes. Tomorrow I&#39;ll melt chocolate in milk again and put it on top as a ganache, with PB cups chopped on top. (I used the recipe on this page to make GF PB cups: https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/homemade-peanut-butter-cups.)

ALSO DELICIOUS.</p><p>- I noticed that the peanut butter really did not make an appearance in the final product (maybe I did something wrong), but the peanut oil seeped out of the springform pan and onto the cookie sheet. Which I don&#39;t think was a problem, but maybe add more peanut butter? OR perhaps mix it into the batter?</p><p>- I misread the instructions, and melted butter for the crust, but then (Stupidly) measured out 6 tbsps of the melted stuff and only put that in. The crust was definitely drier than I would&#39;ve liked, it, so don&#39;t make the same mistake as me. Always add a lot of butter.</p><p>-I also didn&#39;t have an electric mixer, which resulted in a pretty lumpy batter. Luckily I had some extra muscle on hand to stir it up, but I think an electric mixer would have made things easier :p</p><p>- I added cut up peanut butter cups into the batter (before I poured the chocolate part on) and it was SUCH a good idea. They melted into the cake, and it was impossible to see them, but they definitely made the cake richer and more velvety. They added a distinct &#34;peanut butter cup&#34; taste. Very good.</p>"

I made homemade fudge sauce for the top, but the recipe I have gets hard when chilled.  Luckily, I had time to go to the store and buy a jar because the other would have been too hard to cut through without tearing the cake apart.

What I found I didn&#39;t care for was the filling that went into the apples.  The white sugar/cornstarch/water/melted butter left an odd flavor, bland and odd at the same time.  Maybe instead of white sugar, I would use brown sugar with some spices such as cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg."

Went together fine and liked not having to get out the rolling pin.  I cooked the sugar, corn starch and water for the filling in the microwave---so easy that way them added the apples.  I also added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg because of personal preferences.  Flavor was excellent.  My complaint is that the topping got very soggy quickly.  Maybe it was kind of apples I used or fact that I stored pie in a Tupperware pie container with a tight fitting lid.  Anyway, I am going to make another pie shortly to take to a gathering tonight."

So next time I make this I would have to add the cornstarch slowly.  Also, I baked mine for 40 mins and it was too long.  My crust was hard and it was darker brown (not like the picture)...but then again, I should have known because that is how my oven is...SO YES, I would definitely make this again and just bake it for less time  and would also solve my cornstarch problem.

I have to agree with the other folks. Make your pie filling with spices or it will be bland. I didn&#39;t cook my filling. I went old school and dumped the raw apples, cornstarch, and everything in a bowl, mixed it together, and it baked up just fine. One tip I think you may find useful is you can also use instant oatmeal packets. Just cut back on the brown sugar for the topping (I used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar).  Also, I doubled the recipe for the crust and the topping using 2 packets of Apple Cinnamon oatmeal for each, for a deep dish pie. I just found that saving a cup wasn&#39;t enough for the topping, but boy was it delicious! I used a combination of 3 each Jonathan and granny smith apples and it turned out mighty tasty.

I won&#39;t make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didn&#39;t set right, but I will be using the crust recipe (a 3/4 recipe) for the next pie I make.  Perhaps that will turn out better.Reserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick, so I reserved about 1 3/4 cup, which turned out nicely.  I used 2 different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in.  Unfortunately, this still didn&#39;t really give the filling any flavor.  I was amazed at how thick the water/cornstarch/sugar mixture got after boiling, but it was really jelly-like when I took it out of the oven.  I was worried that it wouldn&#39;t set as it cooled, and it didn&#39;t really.I will say though, that EVERY TOH pie recipe I read calls for a 9&#34; pie dish, but EVERY ONE I make NEEDS a 9.5&#34; Deep Dish pan.  Don&#39;t believe what you read in the recipe; it doesn&#39;t fit in the smaller dish."

I used a smidge of Smart Balance/Amish butter instead of Canola over chicken thighs. I didn&#39;t have Lemon Pepper so squeezed fresh lemon (after rolling it to release the juices) on both sides after browning. Then crisped the thick cut bacon. This is actually easier if you use scissors and cut the bacon in 1-2&#34; pc., cooks quicker also...In a separate cast iron pan, I carmelized 3 small onions in butter and spooned some of the bacon greases into it as needed. Fresh Sharp White Cheddar worked for me as well.I chopped Romaine/Buttercrunch lettuces and rough cut a few Craizines (cranberry raisins) w/coarse pepper, alternating the various delectable pieces with lettuce was almost like Wilted lettuce but better!Brava! I am seriously impressed."

Everyone enjoyed it and cleaned their plate. I will say your chicken breasts won&#39;t cook in 7 minutes on each side. I flattened mine for more even cooking but they still took 30 minutes or more. When I figured they were taking a long time, I cooked the bacon separately, otherwise dinner would have been really late. Once the chicken was done I put some bacon grease in the chicken pan and cooked the onions. I added a bit of chicken broth to the pan to deglaze and I had a bit of a really nice gravy that was totally unexpected.I also worried that cooking everything in the order that the chicken would get cold. I agree the steps should be reversed. Cook the bacon, then onions, then chicken and I suggest adding the onions back to the pan with the chicken to warm them before serving. That way, everything is hot and the cheese will melt. This will definitely be made again in our house!"

I didn&#39;t use the brown sugar, Colby jack, or lemon pepper. I used mozzarella because that&#39;s what I had and garlic seasoning mix because I don&#39;t like lemon pepper. I followed others&#39; suggestions and did the bacon and onion first. I think it would have been better with the Colby jack so next time I&#39;ll make sure I have it and I&#39;ll crumble the bacon because the strips just slide off."

I seasoned the chicken with Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of lemon pepper. After the chicken was cooked, I placed the broken up bacon pieces and onions on top. I then added the cheese and placed a lid on the skillet to allow the cheese to melt. Delicious! I have also subbed swiss cheese for the Colby Monterey Jack. Sometimes, I add sautéed mushrooms to the toppings. This is a great recipe that can be tweaked to meet the tastes of your family."

Really - with bacon, cheese and sweet onions, how could it be bad????  I prepared it in reverse - starting with the bacon.  I chose to dice the bacon before cooking.  After removing the bacon I did the onions.  Be careful not to overdo the onions or you may end up with caramel onions that stick to your teeth.  (I may or may not have learned that the hard way!!) When the onions were done, I removed them to a separate bowl, wiped the skillet out and then cooked the chicken.  Once the chicken was done I piled the fixings up on top and let the cheese melt a bit.  We enjoyed it with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts.  Yum!"

I did modify some things, however. Instead of lemon pepper rubbed chicken, I breaded the chicken in Panko because, I&#39;m not a big fan of lemon pepper. Also, instead of bacon slices, I chopped the bacon into pieces before cooking it, and just piled it on top! The only thing I will do differently next time is put the cheese on top of the chicken, then the onions and bacon on top of the cheese so everything sticks together better. I highly recommend this dish."

My family did enjoy the bread. It was the first recipe I tried out.  Someone else mentioned this comment and I fully agree after making a different recipe. The bread is actually too heavy.  Nice flavor but sits heavy and feels heavy. The biggest difference between this recipe and another I tried was how many eggs.  The other recipe I really liked took 3 eggs. I may have said I would make this again but not anymore.

My pan was 1/2 inch longer, and 1/2 inch wider than the 8x4 recommended. I did glaze it. I’ll have to find a better, and 8x4 pan to make again.

If you put the glaze on as soon as it comes out of the oven, it sets to a somewhat crunchy sugar topping...delicious!"

To eliminate the bread not releasing from the pan do this:  Cut waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan after you spray the pan bottom to hold the wax paper tightly.   Spray the paper after it is in the pan.  After baking, run a knife around the sides to release the bread.  Turn the pan upside down and the bread will slide out.Peal off the wax paper.  Do not spray the sides of the pan to allow the batter to rise and form a nice loaf.  I do this for all of my dessert breads.  I double this recipe and pour it into 3 -  8&#34;x 4&#34; pans and freeze 2 of the loaves.  If making a single recipe I use a 9&#34; x 5&#34; pan.

I was out of milk so used 1/2 c nonfat plain Greek yogurt    1/2 t baking soda. Also I didn&#39;t use the lemon rind, but with the lemon glaze it was VERY (deliciously) lemony. I did heat the glaze until the sugar dissolved. Only baked it for 35 minutes (but split the recipe into 2 smaller pans).This was the best sweet bread I have ever tasted!  Was so light - we ate two loaves in one afternoon (Mom and 3 kids!). Will definitely make it again."

I&#39;d used the peel of 1 large lemon, 1-1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries with 1/8 cup all-purpose flour mixed in with the berries to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the loaves! I&#39;d used 1/4 cup lemon juice and1/4 cup sugar and I cooled the bread at least 20 minutes so that bread had a chance to settle!  I glazed the loaves as soon as they came out of oven.  I&#39;d probably bake the miniature  loaves 40 to 45 minutes and the 7&#34; loaves at least 45 to 50 minutes.

The solution is to reserve 1 Tablespoon of your flour and put in sandwich bag then add your completely dry blueberries and coat them.

Ours is still, from the applewood smoker on the deck. BBQ&#39;d or smoked chops are the absolute best. Breaded with spices and Panko, egg wash, flour etc is the next. Done the way in this recipe they become a little too tough and relatively tasteless. Definitely will not make this one."

I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and onions very thin. The potatoes were delicious, but after 25 minutes the 1/2 inch thick pork chops were dry and way overdone.  I could not see baking this for the recommended hour and a half since the chops are browned, which par-cooks them. I would recommend checking for doneness early.

Two pork steaks and potatoes give my wife and i enough for two meals.  But these are really good.  Brown your pork in a cast iron skillet that is really hot so you get the nice sear.

I would think this would overcook the chops.  Chops are best at 145° f,  which is USDA safe for today&#39;s pork.  I have found browning is often sufficient to nearly reach this temp.  Cooking according to this recipe is a throwback to when a pork chop had to be cooked until it was dry. Cooking above 145°f squeezes the internal fat and juice out of the meat fibers as they contract. The hotter the meat, the more squeezing.  Pork today is much leaner than years ago when it had to be cooked much higher to be safe to eat (to avoid Trichinosis).  I suggest baking the potatoes and sauce first then add the browned meat maybe the last 15 minutes depending on the internal temperature of the browned chops.  Ideally, pull when the meat reaches 145°f."

Sadly, I should have tried the recipe first as written but so many said that additional sauce was needed.  So rather than double the ingredients, I did a 1.5X the amounts and had enough sauce to sufficiently cover the potatoes.  After an hour, I removed the foil and there was so much sauce/juice that the dish was swimming in liquid.  I literally spooned out all of the extra sauce which easily made up the extra 1/2 that I added.  The potatoes were very tender (used a mandolin for thinner slices) and the sauce was a hit -- delicious.  Next time I would brown the chops and only add to the dish at the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I used 1 inch chops and they turned out dryer than I&#39;d like.  Will make again but without the extra sauce"

It took 1 hour and 15 mins to bake on 350 for an hour then 375 for 15 mins. The flavor was delicious og the gravy i added some garlic in it an my potatoes were perfect but my chops were dry tasting. My grandma used to bake her chops with potatoes and i was craving it but this is definently not my grandmas way of making it her chops were very juicy and delicious and the gravy was more liquid like but she is passed so the recipe is still a mystery ??but this helped curbed that craving. I do suggest not adding salt to this dish because the chicken broth already has alot of salt in it!"

Cut in strips or pinch off,) I pinch mine, then Add to boiling broth.  You can continue to add them even when they cover the top. Just take a spoon and put them down, keep adding as long as you can or want to. you will have to make more than one batch of dough.  I usually make 3 batches and use a 6Qt pot. But be careful, they will boil over.  When you are done adding dough, turn heat down, and continue to cook until they are shiny.  Then they are done.  If you want them like a biscuit inside, make bigger pieces to drop in. When you get enough dough, it will thicken itself. I you get it to thick, and more broth, or water.  Serve with Cornbread"

Certainly not from the mountains and if it did I would have eaten at your house 1 time and that would have weaned me. Ain’t even close to what a dumpling should be. Balls of dough that you called a dumpling ( ugh).for one thing milk does not go in dumplings at all. A good strong broth is the flavoring of a dumpling   salt and pepper. A cup or two of cool broth to mix with your flour. Rolled out thin on a floured surface and left for an hour or so. Cut with a pizza cutter in 1”x2” pieces and drop into boiling broth and stir gently continuously to keep from sticking. Salt and pepper to taste and you can thicken with a mixture of plain flour and cold water . Add while it’s at a gentle boil while stirring. Turn down to simmer. It’s very easy to over boil and dumplings will fall apart. Do not put a lid on the dumplings. You can add shredded or cut up chicken if you wish.

We&#39;ll definitely be making it again and again.  I was surprised at how simple the recipe was to taste sooooo good!  I let mine simmer extra long to be sure the dumplings were really done, so it cooked down to a nice chicken stew consistency.  I only used 20 oz. of chicken breast, so between less chicken and simmering down quite a bit, I ran short on servings of the actual stew to go with all those dumplings.

I also added one less cup of chicken. Instead of using 1 2/3 cups biscuit  mix, I used 2 cups using my Mom&#39;s homemade biscuit recipe. This is what I used:2 cups flour, 1 T. baking powder, 1/2 t. salt, 2 T. lard. Mix all ingredients together then add your milk, you may need to add about a tablespoon or so more mix.

When I found out I had a gluten allergy, I had to stop making them (they didn&#39;t have good gf flours then). However, this year when planning cookie gifts for Christmas, I remembered these cookies and found this online version of the recipe. I LOVE these cookies and so does anyone who I make them for! 
This time, to avoid my hands getting so sticky from shaping the balls, I took out about a tablespoon of dough and threw it into my sugar bowl and coated it with sugar and then shaped the ball. This really helped speed up the process and my hands didn&#39;t get so messy. 
Also, I recommend taking the cookies off of the pan almost immediately. With the last pan, I didn&#39;t do this immediately and the cookies collapsed slightly."

If you bake much, the lack of vanilla extract, and the small amount of salt would jump out at you right off the bat.  Also, for those having trouble getting them to be thick an chewy, remember that it&#39;s virtually impossible to over mix dough until you&#39;ve added the flour.  Get it good and fluffy.  Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times if you&#39;re using a stand mixer.  I made the following changes/additions, and the richness of the flavor was extremely popular with friends.  3/4 tsp salt 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tsp Lebkuchengewurz (German Gingerbread Spice)  I use a #40 disher for consistency.  My old convection oven would finish them in 12 minutes.  My recent one takes 14 minutes."

I read through the comments before starting and was worried about the issue with the runny batter, spreading cookies, etc., but I proceeded anyway and the dough turned out perfectly and there was absolutely no major spreading in the oven whatsoever! I did follow the tips about creaming the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and also chilled the dough for 20 minutes before scooping and baking. I&#39;m really not sure why some people had such problems with it, maybe their butter was too soft. I will say that for my family&#39;s taste, I did need to add additional spice. I added a whole extra teaspoon of the ginger and increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and honestly, I could&#39;ve done with even more, which is why after tasting the test batch I rolled them in a cinnamon sugar/pumpkin pie spice mixture. The texture is exactly what I was looking for: soft and chewy with just a touch of crispiness on the outside. These will absolutely be in my Christmas cookie line up for every year to come."

I make a few changes to best suit our taste, but nothing that significantly alters the recipe and they come out perfect every time.  I use Crisco butter flavored shortening to keep the cookies from flattening out too much; 1/2 C. granulated sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar; 1 tsp. each ginger and cinnamon, leaving the amount of cloves the same; roll the dough into 1-inch balls to get 48 cookies; and only dip the tops of the dough balls in granulated sugar before baking, finding that adds enough for us.

The ginger flavor isn’t super noticeable though, if you, like me, crave the warmth of a strong ginger taste. I’ve made a couple modifications to make these cookies healthier and tastier while not compromising the softness of the cookies: 1. Replaced half of the flour with ragi flour. Ragi is a finger millet and has high protein, mineral, and fiber content. 2. Reduced butter to 8 tbsp. With the additions below, there is extra moisture in the batter and no need to use as much butter. You could in fact reduce butter further to 7 or 6 tbsp since I found my batter a little sticky and hard to form into balls. 3. Increased ginger to 3 tsp 4. Added half a cup of shredded coconut 5. Added half a cup of flax seed powder   I haven’t had a problem with the cookies spreading out too thin. In fact I’ve had the opposite issue of them not spreading out enough. It may have to do with where I am located - even in the summer it’s quite chilly. I leave my egg and butter out to let them warm up to room temperature, and use a stand mixer so they get nice and fluffy. I also use molasses which is super sticky, so that may contribute to reducing the spread."

The flavor of these cookies was good, although I think next time I&#39;ll add a little more ginger and a little less sugar. Also, like many other people here, the cookies spread out a lot and became flat once I took them out of the oven. This made them weirdly floppy? I chilled the cookie dough for 30 minutes before forming the cookies and then put them in the fridge again before baking them. Maybe next time I will add more flour or use less butter."

Followed recipe to a T but did sift the flour and dry ingredients together as my ginger and cloves were kinda old. Note: when it says softened butter, I DID NOT microwave the butter. It was just room temp so took awhile before it appeared light and fluffy. In fact I was skeptical about it! Took awhile to achieve light texture and was definitely not fluffy. Proceeded on with the room temperature egg, etc. I did use the hand mixer for adding in the first 1-1/2 cups of the flour mixture but then switched to stirring. Then I made all the balls up. Then I got out a little bowl and put 1/4 cup sugar in as a guesstimate. I rolled the balls in that. It was more than enough. I baked mine 10.5 minutes in a gas oven. Took them out as the cookies cracked and puffed up. They are just perfect. Outside is firm but inside is soft. Best ginger cookie recipe ever!! Hope they will stay soft."

Did everything right I even triple checked the recipe and measurements. It came out as a huge gooey glob. Looks disgusting. Also stop using 3/4 measurements. Make a real recipe with real fkg measurements. Despicable.

I keep seeing comments on the sugar amount, it\&#39;s 1 cup of sugar for the cookies. The additional sugar is to roll the cookies in once you have them formed into the ball. I put mine in a Tupperware container, place one cookie at a time in it roll it around to cover the cookie, then I place the cookie on a cookie sheet and bake. The amount of sugar changes depending on how big or how many cookies I make. I believe that\&#39;s why there\&#39;s no amount for it. I usually start with a cup and go from there. Best of luck."

After reading other baker&#39;s reviews I increased my ginger to 1.5 tablespoons and increased cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Fearing a spread I added 1/4 cup oat flour for chewiness and spread prevention.  Bingo!!!Perfection!  Thank you fellow bakers for the helpful tips.

Both times the directions and cook time came out perfect.  The second time I added 2 tablespoons of ground ginger opposed to 2tsp because I really love Ginger.  I felt that the first batch had too much of the clove flavor and not enough of the ginger.  I used Wakaya pink Fijian ginger which is a high impact ginger, mainly to add a more healthy twist on this delicious recipe. I did not change the amount of cloves. This is now quite possibly the best tasting cookie I&#39;ve ever had.  My wife is a big Baker and she thinks that they&#39;re possibly the best cookie she&#39;s ever had."

The key to getting these to stay soft is to not over bake them (which is very easy to do) 10-12 min max. You almost have to take them out before they look totally done. Also, for those who had issues with spreading, it&#39;s likely also because of the use of only butter in the recipe. Butter makes cookies flatter. I used half butter, half butter  butter flavored crisco and that did seem to help. I think next time though I would use all crisco though.  I also nearly doubled the spices, I tasted the dough first and it just didn&#39;t have that ginger taste I was going for so I adjusted. Instead of rolling in sugar, I used a hard cookie glaze and dribbled it over them-- came out pretty great!"

My mom never made molasses cookies or gingersnaps much, probably because my dad didn&#39;t care for them.  He preferred peanut butter or chocolate chip cookies (which I still make for him, now that my mom has passed away).  So I did a search on the TOH website and came up with this recipe.  Read the reviews and added a couple of tbsp. of chopped crystallized ginger to the dough, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  The cookies turned out fabulously.  My daughter&#39;s classmates and teachers hoovered them up and she received three requests for the recipe.  The cookies are soft, but that coating of granulated sugar makes for a nice thin crisp glaze.  We will definitely be making these again."

I LOVE a robust, full of deep flavour ginger cookie and each time I have tried a recipe (I have tried about 3, I have ALWAYS regretted not adding more of the spices). The alteration I made was: 3 tsp Ginger (instead of 2 tsp), 1 tsp Cloves (instead of 1/2 tsp) and 1.5 tsp Cinnamon (instead of 3/4 tsp). Also, as per previous reviews, I used 3/4 Cup Brown Sugar (Instead of 1 Cup White sugar). I also added in 1/3 cup molasses instead of the 1/4 cup!These where phenomenal!! nice and THICK, just like I was hoping for. Countless recipes before yielded thin, weightless cookies, that lacked in depth of flavour. Whereas these are thick, hearty and chewy. If you liked a fuller spiced cookie I would definitely recommend adding in the extra. I also didn&#39;t miss the added sugar because they were rolled in it anyway ;)"

Well, we needed cookie recipes so I decided to look on tasteofhome, and stumbled upon this recipe. We absolutely love these cookies, they are amazing, the molasses and ginger blend very well together and just like the title, they are big and soft! We make these all the time, my brother had some friends over and said that they wanted cookies so I decided to make these for them, and they ate the WHOLE batch! One his friends said that they were the best cookies he ever tried. Would definitely recommend making these cookies for any occasion. Happy Baking!"

It’s true that it tastes like a Snickers bar, only way better! I have no trouble with the candy falling apart, contrary to what some of the other reviewers have stated. Cutting into the chocolate with a warm, sharp knife will help make the cutting easier. I also add less heavy cream (almost by half) when melting the caramels. I followed other reviewers’ advice on that and it did prevent the caramel from oozing between the layers. Also, in the past, I’ve placed the pan in my freezer to help speed up the hardening process of the different recipes. This candy is especially great when made around Christmas time."

However, like some of the other reviews, I too had a problem with the top icing layer cracking and breaking to pieces when I cut it,  and it didn&#39;t stick to the caramel layer under it. I was dissapointed by that happening and wondered if anyone has a solution to keeping the top icing layer from breaking into many pieces and not sticking to the caramel layer? I followed the directions completely and also followed what the reviewer, spoir10692 wrote on December 22, 2010 to keep the top icing layer from spliting/cracking, and it still didn&#39;t work. I also had a problem of cutting it into nice square pieces since the caramel layer was hard to cut through and it came out in jagged edges. It didn&#39;t look like the evenly cut pieces in the picture at all and I found it took me a long time to made it.

Easy to make, although they take time because of the need to let them harden between layers.  Had no problems with the icing cracking or the caramel running.  We kept them in the refrigerator or freezer until about a half an hour before serving.  To store, I buttered the bottom of a pyrex container lightly, made one layer with the candies, then put parchment paper down and made another layer on top.  Between chilling them and the parchment paper, it kept them from sticking together too much."

What I did was I let the final icing layer set at room temp for several hours prior to putting it in the fridge. I let it set overnight and then when I took it out I let it get to room temp (approx 1 hour) then cut with a paring knife.  The caramel did not run either.

As for the chocolate cracking-not quite sure what you all did. My only problem I had was I did not have a  13 X 9 pan - mine was 18 X 12.  I just used 1/2 of the pan-it was thin but still a HIT! No cracked chocolate- I used giaradelli (sp) milk chocolate. Had that on hand. Plus it was cheaper than nestles at the time.

However, the icing didn&#39;t work well for me.  While cooking, it became very thick and wouldn&#39;t spread.  So I added a tablespoon of butter to thin it out.  It spread very well.  I let it set in the refridgerator and did as the instructions said and let it set out for 20 minutes before cutting.  The icing fell into a million pieces.  So I&#39;m not sure what else I could do.  But it is very delicious as is with or without icing and I would make it again."

I also left out the soup and just started the soup out with the original white sauce amounts called for in the recipe to compensate for no soup. ( I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1 cup milk, some chicken broth and a splash of vinegar.) Instead of precooking my rice I just added in 1/3 cup uncooked rice in the soup and cooked it until done. To add some more substance I threw in about 1/2 cup or so uncooked egg noodles. Very yummy and great topped with Parmesan cheese! Quick and easy and a nice change from traditional chicken noodle soup; will make again."

I read another comment that said they mixed the heavy cream alone until it was stiff and folded it into the mixed cream cheese and powdered sugar. I would highly recommend using this method.

LOVE THIS STUFF) , 1.5 Cup of heavy whipping cream, 4 stalks of celery, 1 small sweet onion, 3 teaspoons of minced garlic, 1 tea. cumin, 2 tea. oragano, 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese,  salt &amp; pepper, 5 cans of northern kidney beans, boiled chicken, shredded the chicken, added everything in crock pot, then added INSTANT MASH POTATOES ( it works GREAT on thicken the sauce, plus great taste) sprinkle some in, stir, thickens instantly, I just judge the thickness. cover &amp; cook on high for 3 hrs. it makes a lot, so I&#39;m sure I will be sharing with family or freezing some."

It&#39;s not going to be that thick chili-consistency, but the heat level is nice and kid-friendly as advertised. I made a few slight alterations: I used about 1 lb of chicken and 1 additional can of beans, since we like our chilies and soups on the chunkier side. I reduced the broth to 2 cups and used liquid from the canned beans when I crushed the 1/2 cup of beans as directed - though I did this with a fork, so it wasn&#39;t perfectly smooth.  The flavors are a nice blend, although I think I will increase the oregano and cumin to compensate for having more chicken and beans next time. The additions of cheese, avocado, and cherry tomatoes are delicious, and oyster crackers are good, too. My very picky son ate seconds - unprompted! Definitely a winner in my book!"

I doubled it and added a can of beans.  It was still a little on the soupy side so I will add more chicken next time.  It needs more than 3 1/2 hours to cook for the chicken and onions to get good and tender.  I would recommend 6 hours in the slow cooker.

I gave it only four stars instead of 5 because I thought it was a little too soupy.  I think when I make it again I will add an extra can of beans and probably a pound of chicken.  Overall though this recipe is very good.

Definitly different than what my mom made growing up (chicana) but SOOO GOOD. I rated 4 because using flour tortillas just isn&#39;t a good idea if you want nice crispy enchiladas, I would consider using flour tortillas more of a wet burrito type dish. They get soggy. I used corn tortillas instead (and a bit of advice that makes a world of difference is lightly frying your corn tortillas in oil on each side before placing filling in and rolling, makes them more durable and much more crispy to hold up against the sauce) and for the sauce (if you like it a bit spicy, even if not they have regular sauce) I recommend &#34;El Pato&#34; you can usally find in the mexican section of any store. I use the yellow or green cans both delcious. Also, I chopped up white onion and put on top of the enchiladas before spreading cheese. I also baked uncovered for an extra 5-10 mins to get the edges extra crispy ( mi familia loves it this way!) . Served with a simple red rice my mom used to make and it was delicious! Also, I did use cubed chicken because I used some left over breasts from the night prior but I will definitly be shredding it next time, my family didn&#39;t really dig that. All in all I love the filling recipe, very very good. Will be keeping this one! Thank you :)"

I made it exactly as described with one small addition. I made a microwave pouch of Mexican rice and before I put the stuffing in each tortilla I put a little bit of the rice.

Since returning three years ago this dish is easily the best we&#39;ve found -- and made -- yet!  Thanks so much for the recipe, Kristi.  My only addition to this was pickled red onions and Lime Crema Sauce (8 oz. sour cream, juice of 1/2 lime and 1/2 tsp. kosher salt) as garnishes.  We&#39;ve both decided it&#39;s a keeper and definitely worth making again and again -- even for company.  P.S.

In the second batch I eliminated the salsa, and used just enough hot sauce to flavor and moisten. I also used corn tortillas, which is what I am used to with enchiladas. I used about half of the can of chilies.I always put a small amount of cream cheese in my enchiladas, - it adds a nice richness, and many people don&#39;t even realize it is there, although they are aware of the richer flavor.

They were delicious, I added a half banana to the icing. I wasn&#39;t sure if the banana would turn the icing a weird color or texture but it turned out great. Next time I will add an entire banana. My icing was a little sticky (meaning it came off a little on the cellophane when transporting it), I&#39;m guessing I could have added more confectioners sugar, but it just seemed like a &#34;ton&#34; of sugar.

I always cut the sugar in half and add a smidgen of stevia leaf powder in order to trim calories and fat from recipes; especially from sugar filled desserts. My bananas were small so I used 3 and mashing them gave me a bit more than a cup.  I also use a non-egg egg replacer because of allergies to eggs.  Some recipes don&#39;t turn out as well using egg replacer but this one turned out beautifully!  I also use an icing sugar made with tapioca flour; due to allergies.  I used half the icing sugar and added about 1/2 cup tapioca flour to help with the volume and DID NOT add in any stevia.  There was still enough frosting to cover the bars and it was still plenty sweet.  Some reviews mentioned that the recipe didn&#39;t make 4 dozen but it does!  I cut into 6 rows (10 inch side) by 8 rows (15 inch side).  They were the perfect size!  I took them to a large gathering and received many compliments on them.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

I wanted to make these for church this morning so was worried about time but they went together quickly and I love that they also bake and cool quickly. I used 4 frozen medium bananas and it was just barely over 1 cup. Used the liquid too that comes with freezing bananas. I used a half sheet pan, I think 15-1/2 x 11-1/4, and it was the perfect size for bar thickness. Baked mine for 23 minutes, rotating pan with 8 minutes left. One rack lower than middle of oven. Nice medium brown on top. Put in the cold garage to cool quickly. I had about 1-1/2 cups of leftover cream cheese frosting I&#39;d used for cookies. Very thick so added maybe a good half a cup of soured milk till the right consistency for a glaze. Spread over the mostly cooled bars, cut into 40 bars which yielded 2 inch sized bars. They were gobbled up at church and we still had some to bring home. My family loved them! These will be my go to banana recipe.

I also put it in for 35 minutes because the middle was too pudding-like, though I was nervous about the browning edges (I live at high-altitude if that&#39;s relevant). Overall, an easy winner to take to work or a family gathering. I put salted caramel in the cream cheese frosting which was amazing.

Were a big hit!!  I also think I would cut the frosting recipe in half (I only used 3/4 of it), or maybe add less powdered sugar so not so sweet.  I will definately make these again.  Nice change from the usual banana bread!!  Would also be deliscious with the tiny chocolate chips, or adding peanut butter to the frosting also."

I also chose to beat the cream cheese with the liquid before adding as opposed to doing the cubes, and I added both a little sugar and pure real vanilla. However I agree with some other remarks that it was too eggy.  I could taste the egg more than the other ingredients and the texture was very dense.  Instead of 6 eggs (again I halved) next time I would do 4 but keep everything else the same.  Sauce is good but very sweet, a little goes a long way.  I will definitely make it again, just change the eggs to help the texture be more like french toast than an egg casserole.  I&#39;d give it higher stars if it wasn&#39;t for the eggs."

I used 1 loaf of Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon Bread and I purposely just used the whole loaf, crusts and all the 2nd time around! I used just 1 package of cream cheese and the 2nd time around, I beat the  8-oz. package of cream cheese with 2/3 cup sugar 5 minutes, then I added 6 eggs and 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract.  I scraped the bottom and sides of bowl and then I added 2 cups of milk.  I used 1 PINT of blueberries for both the casserole and for the blueberry sauce.  For the sauce, I&#39;d added 2 Tbsp. bottled lemon juice and I stirred the sugar and cornstarch together before adding the water, then cooked the 3 minutes until it came to a boil.  I stirred in the blueberries, lowered the heat and cooked 10 minutes or untilthe berries burst. After removing from the heat, I stirred in 1 Tbsp. butter. I think that creaming the sugar with the cream cheese makes this dish more flavorful than just cubing it! I&#39;d spritzed the 13x9x2&#34; baking pan with PAM, used a paper towel to spread the spray around and I&#39;d placed the bread cubes in the prepared pan.  Then I added the berries and poured the milk/egg mixture over the bread cubes and berries.  I did allow the French toast to sit, covered, 8 hours on the 2nd time around and then cut vents in the foil to allow the steam to escape!  I also did allow the dish to sit, covered, 1/2 hour before baking, then I baked, covered, 30 minutes at 350o F. and then uncovered the dish and baked 30 minutes more.  For an added touch, I sprinkled 4 tsp. cinnamon-sugar over top on the 2nd time around!  I think that my 2nd time worked much better-the first time, I felt that I could improve this recipe! Using sugar is better for me than using honey or maple syrup!My first time around, I&#39;d used about 9 Tbsp. maple syrup all together and I&#39;d used 2 cups of milk!  I still stuck to 6 eggs, though and the 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract. The first time around I HAD cubed the 8-oz. package of cream cheese and topped with the remaining bread cubes and blueberries!The sauce is GREAT!   I&#39;m finding that what may work for the original recipe with 1 person-for me, it helped to make these additional improvements to have a dish proudly served!delowenstein"

First of all it was to &#39;Eggy&#34; for me. So I&#39;d strongly suggest that you NOT use a dozen of eggs that this calls for! That&#39;s just WAY to much egg. The ladys at Church liked it but I can&#39;t believe this is a Grand prize winner. I won&#39;t be making this again. I was so disappointed! One lady at Church had to actually spit it out of her mouth. She said sorry but there&#39;s way to many textures going on with this. I did really like the homemade blueberry syrup however. I would rank the Syrup Only a 5 but not the casserole. I find it surprising that So many of ya&#39;ll like this so well.

It is also a favorite of anyone that tries it.  I have made some minor revisions.  I use one one 8 ounce block of low fat cream cheese and a whole loaf of white bread minus 4 slices ( it makes it more substantial).  I use 2+ cups of blueberries in the casserole ( one is not enough for an 9x13 pan)  I also make a double batch of the syrup but only add 1 total cup of sugar.  This allows a person to really add a nice scoop of syrup.  If you add 2 cups of sugar it is much too sweet.  I have the perfect breakfast treat  !!

They thought it was very good. I had to bake it 10+ minutes longer than the recipe called for and that eliminated the mushy-bread-egg condition that sometimes comes with an overnight egg bake dish. I used Vienna bread and it was fine. My revisions for next time: leave the crusts on (that was time-consuming) and I may layer the top of the bread with thinner slices of cream cheese rather than the 1&#34; cubes. Not everyone around my breakfast table was a big fan of cream cheese chunks. I also thought that I might try using raspberries rather than blueberries to see how that goes. All in all, this was a very nice change from the usual french toast or egg back recipe!"

It is skim milk and a lot of sugar. Heavy Cream or real full fat half and half are far better than the chemical  storm known as fat free half and half. It actually should not be legally called half and half its skim milk and sugar. Devoid of flavor and substance filled with nasty chemicals and sugar. Why do we have an obesity problem in this country because of misnomers like this.  dictionary says a wrong or inaccurate use of a name or term when speaking of fat free half and half.

I  don&#39;t have to add any extra chicken bouillon.  If I need extra salt I add 1/4 tsp of celery salt.  I always have reserve bacon grease so if I don&#39;t have any bacon on hand it has the flavour in the soup already.  It is nice to change it up once in a while.

My family and guests thought it was great and finished every drop.

I didn&#39;t have clam juice but I had shrimp shells saved in the freezer so I boiled those for broth and used that in place of the clam juice and it worked good. I made a double batch. I also had less than half the onion called for, but I had green onions growing in my garden and used about a cup of those in place of one of the onions. I ended up adding 1 extra can of clams.. first reason was because I bought a pallet of them on clearance. Yeah. I thought it was a good move. And I wanted the extra clams because I was short on that clam juice. -- Also, I&#39;m going to try it again lower carb by only using 1 small potatoes and then chopped cauliflower and I might try cream cheese in place of the flour.

Instead of 1 cup water i added another bottle of clam juice since i was using fresh clams there was no juice. I also cut the bouillon down since i was using the extra juice. i also used heavy cream instead of half and half so i didn&#39;t need the flour. Sprinkled black pepper on top after it was cooked..It was a hearty thick creamy soup and i will definitely make it again. This is the second time i&#39;ve made it so i knew it needed some tweaking.

The directions were a bit confusing though...pudding doesn&#39;t come in 1-ounce packages that I could find (so I used a large instant vanilla pudding mix) plus the cooking time for a yellow cake was about 35 minutes, not 15-20. I may have used the wrong cake mix as suggested (I used a regular size yellow cake mix) because of the 9x13 pan. I also mixed the crushed pineapple with the pudding and cream cheese then spread it on the finished cake. Okay, I didn&#39;t use anything remotely healthy and went with full-fat cream cheese, pudding, milk, and Cool Whip.  The end result was fantastic and I will definitely make this again."

And the part where you are supposed to sprinkle the pineapple on, then try to spread Cool Whip over that? Really? That would  just make a mess, in my opinion. None of my ingredients are fat or sugar free or low fat. I used two Jiffy cake mixes.  I was out of instant pudding, so I used the Cook &amp; Serve pudding, cooled it and mixed it in with the cream cheese. The pudding blends nicely with the cream cheese.  In a bowl, I folded the Cool Whip  into the drained  pineapple and spread that on, then added some cherries on the top. I skipped the nuts.  It looks quite pretty.

Then I followed the instructions as directed, except that I used neufchatel cheese instead of fat free cream cheese because it has even fewer calories, and then I omitted the walnuts because my husband doesn&#39;t like them.  So with even less calories, I increased the serving size so there were 16 slices instead of 20.  It was excellent!  Even my 4-year old ate a whole piece!

Never used capers cuz I never knew what they were and never had them but even without those, this recipe is really good! It’s very light and airy. Pair it with some rice and broccoli and you got yourself a quick affordable meal. Also, to the person saying this recipe is bland. I recommend using the lemon butter mixture before you cook them and when they come out put more of the mixture on it. This helps with the flavor. Btw if you’re not a huge fan of lemons like me, I would probably use alittle less lemon juice than it asks for cuz the lemon can get pretty bold compared to the other flavors.

Everything about it works wonderfully and the taste is FANTASTIC. I do not enjoy fish much at all and I especially usually don&#39;t enjoy the taste of tilapia. I&#39;ve tried several recipes and they&#39;re &#39;OK,&#39; but this one made the fish taste terrific. I grabbed this recipe about an hour before I was to cook and was out of capers, so I searched for a substitution. My google search result recommened subbing with something tangy that has a bit of a bite to it, there were several options. I chose to substitute capers with a spicy baby dill pickle, all it took was one and it worked great! If you use a spicy baby dill, also, be sure to mince it up, really fine, because it spreads the flavor out evenly over the fish, when it&#39;s cut up tiny.  The only other substitution I made was using 1 tsp   fresh minced garlic (= 2 cloves), because I think it tastes better than garlic powder, just my taste preference. Everyone loved this recipe and I definitely will be using it whenever we eat tilapia, in the future! Well done, TOH!"

Capers are the unripened flower buds of Capparis spinosa, a prickly, perennial plant which is native to the Mediterranean and some parts of Asia. After the buds are harvested, they are dried in the sun, then pickled in vinegar, brine, wine or salt. The curing brings out their tangy lemony flavor, much the same as green olives.The size of the buds range from tiny (about the size of a baby petite green pea) up to the size of a small olive. The smallest variety from the South of France, called nonpareil, is the most prized and comes with an equally notable price-tag. Larger capers are stronger in flavor and less aromatic."

It is very rich so I only use a single layer at a time. The cake (minus frosting) also freezes very well.  Then I can thaw the cake and frost it for an easy item to bring.  I make 1/3 of the butter frosting recipe for the single layer, but keep the ganache the same.  I top with a variety of fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blue berries &amp; kiwi. Each single layer piece is still packed with flavor and allows for more servings with a large party."

I used 2 cake mixes in 9x13 in pans- was afraid it wouldn&#39;t be enough for  everyone.  I had to increase the baking time, of course. Kept checking for doneness- ended up 40+ minutes at same temp. Didn&#39;t  need 2x frosting and really not 2x ganache - but I used all of it! I cut the strawberries in half to cover larger cake surface. I used choc chips for the semi-sweet chocolate and melted in microwave-that worked great. Next time I will use a plastic bag with hole snipped in corner to &#34;pipe&#34; the decorative designs.  Never got runny enough to drizzle from a spoon and was a mess to get out of my cake decorator once it hardened.  Transported the decorations in a shirt box wrapped in waxed paper and inserted just before we ate dessert.  Swore I would not make again if it was only as good as the box mix, but everyone raved. I guess it will become a tradition!"

If you bake them a bit longer than recommended the crust holds up better in bar form.  I often bake them 45-50 mins at home.  Never had a burnt crust.  The convection ovens at the bakery were definitely faster.  If they come out with softer crust just cut into smaller “2-bite” size pieces or eat with fork.  The batter is very thick.  Fist time I made I I though I did something wrong. You can easily alter the amount of sugar to your liking.  Change up the filings, extracts and nuts or other add-in’s as you choose.  It’s pretty forgiving.  It’s kinda bad hard to mess up this recipe. Under-baking is usually the biggest issue, as is not using enough filling.  At a bakery you can’t skimp on fillings.  Customers don’t like that :-).  If you do add the drizzle on top it will make the bars a bit wet it the sit out all day.   Bakery tip: For dryer drizzle use less milk.  It should be very thick - as in “not a drizzle at all” but kinda toothpaste like.  Then heat in microwave, no more than 10 seconds at a time. Gets super hot very fast.  Once hot, drizzle quickly, as it will harden/get crusty very quickly.  Once it drys on the bars it won’t make them overly soft.  Works great and you can remix remaining crusted drizzle (with few drops of liquid) and reheat if it gets too difficult to work with.  I burned myself a few times with the hot mix so be careful not to overheat it"

Good God I could have built a chimney.  However, I was able to rescue this.  I had used half-and-half instead of 2%, and ended up having to add an ADDITIONAL 2 cups of 1% milk.  I doubled the spices as well.  With some TLC, it came out irresistible.  I cooked 24 ounces (two boxes) of the Prince Thick and Hearty elbows.  For topping, I melted 2 T. butter and added 1/2 cup panko and tossed to mix.  Sprinkled it on top then sprinkled an additional 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar.  Convection baked at 325 degrees for 9 minutes in my counter oven.  All family gave it 4 1/2 stars!  Some recipes I have call for a little nutmeg in the sauce and others have called for a little dijon mustard.  Both are good."

This one, I had to.  I found this recipe about 4 months ago and made it, not holding out much hope that my kids would like it..they never like homemade mac and cheese.  The family devoured this casserole. Then I lost the recipe and couldnt find it until yesterday, they devoured it again! Some changes did have to be made.1. I used a whole box of bow ties and needed a little bit more, it was very saucy.  I like it like that so it didnt bother me.2. Yes, the sauce does get a little too thick, i just slowly added chicken broth to get to a good consistency for us.3.  GRATE your own cheese! It makes a world of difference in that grainy taste, plus its cheaper.I can finally stop looking for a mac and cheese recipe, this will be the only one i ever make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!"

I really dislike crisp cookies so I made them a little bigger than the rounded tsp and baked them for 8 minutes, but found even that to be too long! I ended up baking for 6 minutes and letting cool on the cookie sheet for 1.5 minutes before removing to a wire rack. They didn&#39;t really spread at all.

I found the recipe years ago but I don&#39;t care for peanut butter.  So I simply use marshmallow cream and whip it up in the mixer and then continue with the recipe replacing the peanut butter with the marshmallow cream.   These make great mallow cups.  I keep the recipes ingredients around for when I get the taste for some chocolate.  I make them in a regular cupcake pan and then wrap and take them to church for others so I don&#39;t pig out on them

So much easier to make and you lessen the risk of not using the chocolate in time for it going all dry and lumpy.I  bought candy/sweet clear bags.  I tripled the amount of mixture.   I used a non stick reusable sheet and lined an oven tray it covered almost half the tray the layers.   I used galaxy bars, no cheap chocolate chips.  So  much smoother a taste for the chocolate really adds to the taste from what i&#39;ve been told and I added Himalayan pink salt to the  mixture of peanut butter.Microwaves are bad for you so i didn&#39;t use one , i don&#39;t have one,  it changes the cellular structure of food and is harmful to dna.  i just used a stainless steel pot  on the cooker, filled with water on 3 and a smaller one on there for the chocolate mix and the the peanut butter mix.I did first layer put in freezer for 20 mins then did the peanut layer, easier to spread it when bottom layer is hard,  same in freezer 20 mins then last layer of chocolate back in the freezer for 20 mins.  Then using a cleaver, I cut it into big bars looks perfect and great.I got 3 pounds 8 ounces worth of bars and 10 big bars out of it.  Much much easier to make these than to try make perfect cups.  Anyone i&#39;ve made these for prior, absolutely lovesssssss the taste.So going  to wrap in greaseproof paper, then in yellow tissue paper inside the bag, then put into the clear bags, tie on yellow ribbons and glue a chick and an egg on ribbon and hand out  for Easter  :)Would be great fora photo upload function."

Before he became allergic he ENJOYED peanut butter cups.  Hasn&#39;t had one in 6 years.  So for Valentine&#39;s Day I decided to substitute soy butter for the peanut butter in this recipe and it turned out AWESOME!!!  You really can&#39;t tell the difference and he got to enjoy a long lost treat.  I did prepare the soy butter filling ahead but only added an extra 1/2c conf. sugar because the soy butter is a little dryer than peanut butter and didn&#39;t want filling to crumble.  Think next time I will add some crushed up pretzels to this and enjoy 3 great tastes together :-)  Excellent alternative for people allergic to peanuts!!!

I used a teaspoon melon baller to scoop heaping spoon of melted chocolate into cups then a slightly smaller one for peanut butter then back to larger one for top chocolate. Also put your cups on a tray covered in foil or pretty paper then you can refrigerate and serve on same tray. I don&#39;t think it was messy at all and when I melted chocolate and peanut butter I put pb on bottom glass dish then Choc. Melted about 45 secs stirred then another 45 secs. Wonderful and Very Easy!

I had no trouble melting the chocolate mixture in the microwave.  I used half power and checked (and stirred!)every 30 - 45 seconds~~no problem.  I did increase the powdered sugar to 1 cup and rolled the mixture out into 3 logs each 9 inches and them scored them every 3/4 inch and refrigerated them until firm. Then followed the directions for putting them together in the recipe putting the little &#34;chucks&#34; of peanut butter mixture in each cup instead of having to spoon it in.  I was really impressed that this recipe worked out perfectly with the quantities given and made the 36 cups exactly.  I&#39;ll use it again.

I have used corn and peas, also mixed frozen veggies and peas and carrots - whatever I have on hand - or am in the mood for. I have been known to make the meat and veggie mixture - in multiples of the amount in this recipe -  in a Dutch oven so I can freeze some for later use. Have also added mushrooms, fresh (preferably) or canned. I always grind a generous amount of pepper into the base - always taking samples for tasting before  calling it complete - the same with salt - which I go easy on.

I always use Yukon Gold potatoes to make mashed potatoes with--it really ratchets up the flavor.

Update--9/21/2017:  I am scheduled for foot surgery soon and cannot stand for long periods of time SO I made this even quicker.  For the sauce, I used Campbell&#39;s Beefy Mushroom soup with some sour cream added and for the potatoes, I made very thick instant ones with some of the sour cream added.

I also used store-bought mashed potatoes.At the end I stuck it all in a dish, and put it in the oven at 350deg for about 15 minutes.  Next time I will also broil it for a couple minutes too, like others suggested.One thing I did notice was a distinct sweetness to it.  I think it was a combination of the ketchup and the large amount of corn.  Next time I will cut down on the corn and add in a different veggie (maybe broccoli).  While the sour cream made the &#34;sauce&#34; taste good, I didn&#39;t really get a strong sour cream flavor (info for those who are on the fence about adding in the sour cream).Overall, a good dish, and pretty quick when using leftover or store-bough mashed potatoes.

This is a great sub-in when you&#39;re craving lasagna but don&#39;t want to spend the hours making one from scratch.

It was delicious the way it was, but I agree with other commenters that it could use extra sauce. Next time i will add an 8oz can of good quality pizza sauce as well. I will also substitute about a third of the mozzarella for fontina, and add parmesan to the top. And will add an Italian sausage or two to the ground beef.

Taking my own cue for the traditional lasagna I typically make, the next time I made this I added some chopped onion and baby portabella mushrooms, and I used one package of ground beef plus I  added one pound of bulk Italian sausage.  Once thry were all cooked together, I  layered the ravioli  ( cheese only)  the sauce, the mozarela cheese, plus I also added a package of provolone cheese slices, divided, and I topped twitch one half a jar of Alfredo sauce.  I then repeated the ayers , endings with the red sauce and cheese, and baked as directed.  It&#39; is  a lot easier than putting the traditional lasagna recipe together.

Both were wonderful and garnered big thumbs up!! Thanks to the other reviewers for suggesting sausage instead of beef, it really added richness to the dish.Other minor changes: I used two types of ravioli: cheese and portabella-cheese. I used one jar of marinara and one jar of vodka sauce and a shredded blend of mozzarella, parmesan, and romano.As far as steps, I followed them exactly, and it was easy as pie (and as tasty!).

I also substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillon, added the carrot mixture when I added the chicken, and added some salt and pepper.

Don&#39;t skip adding sliced sweetened strawberries - it gives this recipe a wonderful fresh flavor and texture. Personally I prefer making homemade whipped cream using heavy whipping cream.

I substitute real heavy whipping cream for a more natural taste, and it holds up nicely.  I also use other fruits sometimes (black cherries with black cherry jello; blueberries with blueberry jello).  This is a dessert best eaten as fresh as possible, as the pretzels will start to get soft after the first day.  I typically bake my crust the day before, but wait until about 4 hours before serving to assemble.  Be sure to completely cool/chill each layer before adding the next.  Let the pretzel crust cool to room temp first!  Chill after adding the cream cheese mix.  And most importantly, let your jello mix cool before adding it to the top, otherwise it will disturb the cream cheese mix and you&#39;ll have very unattractive chunks of white in your red jello.  Also be sure that the pretzel crust is sealed off from the jello, or it will get soggy."

I don&#39;t normally like pretzels but this dessert is phenomenal!! For the most part,  I followed the receipe but I changed a couple things. I made it in a 9&#34;X13&#34; glass dish. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. I did NOT add any extra sugar. I really like the filling so I doubled the cream cheese. Basically,  I make the crust than I mix the jello topping and while it&#39;s in the fridge,  I make the filling.  I folded in the whip cream instead of mixing it all together. That takes about 20 minutes or so. Then, I poured the jello topping on top and put back  in the fridge and it turned out perfect. IF you follow the directions, everything should fit nicely.  However,  since I added the extra cream cheese,  the topping was overflowing. I just poured in what fit and it was perfect!!! Ive read that people using fresh strawberries add extra sugar to them but I didn&#39;t and it doesn&#39;t need any...but that&#39;s up to you. As for the extra jello that wouldn&#39;t fit, I just put it in a seperate bowl,  and after it was set up, added some whipped cream and had that as an extra dessert!!! Everyone loves this dessert...I will make it for everything!!"

I bought all of the ingredients as written, but did end up with 2 1/2 cups of coarsely crushed pretzels as I did not want to toss them. It still worked fine and amply covered the bottom of the dish. The crème cheese layer worked best by beating the crème cheese and sugar and then folding in the whip topping, as another reviewer recommended. I was skeptical about the jello layer but followed instructions exactly and it worked fine. I put in fridge after first layer for about 30 minutes. Second layer a bit longer and def spread to edges, as another reviewer wisely recommended. Jello layer chilled for a few hours. Sliced beautifully. Looked pretty on a plate. Did not top with additional whip cream, and honestly it did not need any extra sugar, so that would have mainly been for plating. This is where I have to say, it was way too sweet. no way around it either but I may remove the syrup filled strawberries with fresh. The other steps could perhaps be reduced in sugar, but not eliminated as the sugar serves more than one purpose. SO, aside from being overly sweet, this would be a very nice desert. I would never name this a salad or serve WITH a meal though."

The recipe says to boil water then dissolve the jello in a bowl. That doesn&#39;t cook it any further and the bowl actually brings the temperature down. Did you dissolve it in the pot while still simmering/boiling? I wouldn&#39;t even boil the water. Just get it hot enough to dissolve the jello. Hope this helps and is in time for you to try again.

I found it interesting that it only called for the boiling water to make the jello but it worked. The Jello box calls for two cups boiling and two cups ice cold water. My guess is person who commented they had too much jello followed recipe on Jello box and not this recipe. I sliced up frozen strawberries as I didn’t have pre-sliced and added them when not completely thawed to act as substitute for cold water and it worked. The jello doesn’t look as pretty as picture but that may be because I let it sit too long to gel in freezer.

To avoid issues that some people had you MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO KITCHEN TIPS LISTED &amp; DETAILS1)  Cool crust COMPLETELY.( I CHILL THE CRUST after it has cooled a bit on counter) Be sure to spread the cream cheese layer ALL THE WAY TO OUTER EDGES, so that it is touching the edges of the pan.(then chill)..This avoids letting the jello topping  seep down into the crust DO NOT cut the amount of sugar IN THE CRUST.PART of recipe.It is needed to make it crispy.To speed up the jello portion I dissolve the sugar ( 1/2 C. to 2/3 Cup  NOT 1 full cup) into ONLY 1 CUP BOILING WATER....Then when sugar is FULLY DISSOLVED I add in the remaining  1 Cup VERY COLD water ( OR  COLD juice) drained off from thawed strawberries to equal1 cup ) Be very sure the jello is partially set before spooning evenly over CHILLED cream cheese  layerYou do not want the jello fully set BUT you DO NOT  want it to be a pourable liquid either. IF  the jello fully sets before you get to it...just warm SLIGHTLY for a FEW SECONDS AT A TIME in the microwave till it is SEMI SET. BT not warm. Sometimes I grate some dark chocolate over the whipped cream garnish dallops, before adding the pretzel garnish....If I remember to pick up some chocolate  covered pretzels for the garnish,Good recipe but the directions could include more specific details and the sugar in the jello could be cut down to 2/3 cup....maybe even 1/2 C. especially if the frozen strawberries are sweetened type.."

The cream cheese layer is delicious and super sweet and very, very thin (and would be just very thin in the smaller pan.)  It would also make a good dip for fresh berries.

As usual w/ me, I tweaked it to fit my needs/taste. Even with doubling this, I used a bit more chicken, red &amp; green peppers, onion and garlic. Plus I used a bit less cheese (not a fan of too much ooey-gooey cheese). I used olive oil instead of canola oil.
Turned out exactly as I had envisioned. 
Oh, who came up with “35 min prep time”??. This was time consuming, but so is any homemade dish that requires this much cutting, blending, sautéing, etc. Be prepared for a cpl of hours. It was worth it.

I did not have chicken thighs on hand so I used chicken breasts - I used 1.5 pounds. I added 2 cups of gluten free penne pasta.  Along with the spices (except red pepper flakes) mentioned to use I also added Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and black  pepper - did not measure just eyed it when added. I also added 1 cup of sodium free chicken broth due to the extra half cup of pasta. Cooked as instructed and the remaining uncovered was cooked for only 15 minutes.

I did do a few short cuts though.  I didn&#39;t blend the tomatoes and it turned out just fine.  I only simmered the chicken mixture 10 minutes and only left the dish in the oven for 10 minutes after uncovering.  It still was delicious.  Ground beef or sausage could easily replace the chicken.  I&#39;m not a big fan of chicken in red sauces but most dishes of this kind use beef or sausage so the chicken was a nice change of pace.  The chicken could even be shredded or cut very small so it&#39;s not as noticeable.  This could easily be prepared ahead of time for a busy next day.  Prepare the chicken mixture and refrigerate since it&#39;s the step that takes the longest or prepare the entire dish and bake it the next day.  We are a family of 5 and so there is only a few small servings left over.  Next time I may double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8.

Also, scared for it to be &#34;bland&#34; as I knew I&#39;d be leaving out salt to accommodate sodium-restricted family members, I took the advice of doubling up the other spices.

I did read some of the reviews and made some changes. I used Italian style tomatoes without blending and I increased the basil and oregano to 2 teaspoons. It gave the dish plenty of flavor.  I baked it for 30 minutes then removed the cover and finished cooking the last 10 minutes. It was perfect. We will be having this again. I highly recommend it.Volunteer Field Editor

Never once until today have I read that the whites should be whipped until stiff. Mine have always turned out perfectly just by using an manual egg whipper. I found that adding an additional 2-3 Tbls. of flour reduced the looseness of the batter. I personally like a cakier macaroon. 
I also use coconut extract instead of vanilla. That change made all the difference in a just so so cookie to a great one.
A couple of Christmases I got a phone call from a complete stranger in P.A. who had eaten some of these macaroons I had sent to former neighbor of mine. She was calling to ask for my recipe!"

Rather than going by volume - I went by weight, using a single package that weighed 7 oz. 

With this, I scaled up the amount of each ingredient - 1/2 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, 3/4ths tsp of vanilla, and three egg whites. The result was a puffy, toasty cookie that didn&#39;t spread. I had to bake it a bit longer at 325 as well - maybe set an 18-20 minute timer and check to see if the tops are toasty."

It never ceases to amaze me how people can supposedly follow the same recipe with such different results.  Toll house cookies being the prime example.  Anyway, sorry, I did change it a little.  I have made macaroons before and just wanted to experiment--however, I didn&#39;t change any measurements just tweaked things a little.  I used almond flour, rum instead of vanilla, added some candied ginger and a dark chocolate button on top.  They&#39;re fabulous but I mainly wanted to mention how they came together.  They didn&#39;t but I piled them in heaps on the cookie sheet, anyway, and they&#39;re fine.  Also, this recipe with no change in amounts on the ingredients, made 23 big macaroons.  Macaroons are so rich and sweet and, basically unhealthy, most recipes don&#39;t recommend making them very big.  Can&#39;t figure out how people could think the recipe doesn&#39;t make enough.  Last of all, I think the freshness of the eggs makes a difference.  Staler egg whites are watery.  I could have used a little of that."

I bake in Germany, so have two differences:  I used unsweeteed DRY coconut, and I bake on parchment. The mix was not overly sticky, so I could form small balls instead of using two spoons (probably due to the low moisture content of the coconut). They baked like a charm. I got 15 cookies from this recipe. I took them to my first Holiday party with my new company, and my boss inhaled them.

I had a little trouble getting them off the first pan, but I think that&#39;s because I let them cool a little before transferring them to a wire rack.  For the second pan, I transferred them as soon as they came out of the oven, and it was no trouble at all.

Initially, our first thought was, it makes too much for our little family of two, so we decided to cut the recipe in half. It sounded delicious.Once it came out of the oven, that was a different story. The amount of bacon coupled with the sour cream overpowers the dish, so the balance of flavors is too rich. Because the potatoes are such a neutral flavor, they get lost in the casserole. Maybe if you use less of the sour cream and bacon, or more potatoes, that would be the right ratio of bacon to toppings. Also, the presentation wasn&#39;t very appealing, because the whiteness of the sour cream dominates the other colors.Sadly, this recipe will not be added to our recipe box. Happy cooking! :)"

Our family does like a little extra flavour in our food, so we usually add more spices than a recipe calls for. And I did add a few extras to make more soup to last longer with portions to freeze for later. Apart from the basic recipe: I added 1 can black beans, 1 diced green pepper, 1 diced white onion, 1/2 can leftover tomato soup (just to avoid wasting it.) Some cumin, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, parsley, adobo seasoning, chipotle chile powder, and about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and some more water. I added black olives to mine but not the entire pot, because a lot of people hate olives. I love them though and they are a great addition! Then we topped as desired with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crushed tortilla chips when serving. It worked out great. This recipe is versatile in how you can add to it or adjust it to make it work for you / stretch it for extra servings. I would have never thought about using the ranch dressing packet but that was a good idea."

What hungry adult is  going to eat only 1 cup? A doctor at the Mayo Clinic is quoted as telling us (who are NOT on a low salt diet) to consume 2000 mg of salt for the WHOLE day so with a cup and a half you will be eating more than is healthy. It may be delicious but I&#39;ll have to pass.

I laughed so hard I cried.  From that day forward me nor my brother would eat mamas porcupine meatballs.  Tomorrow is my brothers 47th birthday.  I am skipping the cake and bringing stinky.  I can&#39;t wait to see his face.  Happy Birthday Mikey.  This also dispelled that old rumor that Mikey will eat anything . he won&#39;t."

First, I only use 1/4 c water in the meat mixture, and add an egg to help bind the ingredients when mixing - otherwise they tend to fall apart. I use a quick rice. Also, I microwave the onion in a tsp of water for 1.5 minutes before mixing in with rest of ingredients. Most importantly, I make 1.5 times the sauce by increasing all of the ingredients by 1.5 except the water, which I leave at 1c. (I use Italian seasoned tomato sauce.) This way we have plenty of sauce, as we like to enjoy this dish over mashed potatoes.  PS: Remember to cover the dish while cooking or your rice may not get done!

I&#39;d been craving porcupine meatballs, a memory from childhood.  I also babysit my great-grandson once a week and wanted something for lunch that might appeal to a 2 1/2 year old.  I followed the instructions to the letter except for the celery salt.  I had some, but I couldn&#39;t remember how old it was so I omitted that ingredient.  The meatballs were perfect...the rice perfectly cooked and the sauce was thick and savory.  I only meant to sample them as they are to be our lunch tomorrow.  I put three on a saucer and ended up going back for three more.  (I&#39;m actually tempted to go back a 3rd time.)  I&#39;ve copied the recipe and added it to my notebook of favorites.  Someone suggested that the ones who complained of undercooked rice might have made the meatballs too big.  I simmered mine exactly an hour and the rice was just right."

To make it even easier (and the way my grandma did it), is to not brown the meatballs.  Mix the meatball ingredients, shape into meatballs and put in an even layer in a casserole dish and pour the soup mixture over.  Cook at 350, covered,  for 30 minutes. Remove cover and cook for 30 more minutes. Then I put them on top of mashed potatoes, spoon sauce over all and enjoy!

I simply doubled the ingredients because I just couldn&#39;t see 1 pound of hamburger filling up three people. We used white instant rice for the recipe and it worked great in my opinion.Two adults and our 16 year old daughter. She ate five of the twenty meatballs that I was able to make for the 2 pounds of burger. I browned in olive oil on medium high heat and basically just browned both sides because the 12&#34; skillet was a little crowded. I removed the browned meatballs to a plate while I disposed of the grease from the pan. I also rinsed the pan with hot water once the grease was gone. I returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with the sauce (2x recipe for me).Simmered on a low bubble for 45 minutes (turning the meatballs a couple times). They were just great. I couldn&#39;t believe my daughter ate five of the twenty I made. My only suggestion is to take the time to make the meatballs evenly sized, and to be sure and mix the ingredients thoroughly before turning into meatballs. I suppose the only thing I changed was that I mixed only 3/4 cup of water to the ground beef and added two eggs. In the sauce I did not add the water at all, just the two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce, 4Tsp of Worchestershire sauce, and 4 Tbsp of brown sugar.15 of the 20 meatballs were eaten. Only due to stomach capacity of 3 satisfied Kansan&#39;s. We will make this more often. So easy!"

The only tweek I made was to follow the  suggestions of sprinkling lemon and sugar on the peaches, letting sit half and hour and using the bit of juice that accumulated in with the water part of the recipe. I don\&#39;t think it made that much difference so following spot on should come out just as well. I didn\&#39;t know what would happen with that water formula.

This is a fantastic recipe when you have fresh peaches in the summer. It&#39;s probably good with frozen or canned peaches too, but I save this for when I have fresh ones. For the topping, you need to let it boil for a bit and reduce before pouring on the batter, think like syrup or even a caramel consistency. I add a little corn syrup to the topping mix just to prevent any crunchy sugar bits. The cream as indicated by the recipe is good, but some ice cream I think is even better.

Oh, and those of you who do not understand why there is no measurement on the half and half at the end, it&#39;s  because you&#39;re just supposed to pour it over the cobbler to your own liking.

I&#39;m thinking it is used at serving time of the cobbler.  In the ingredients list it is half &amp; half CREAM.  In the directions it is referred to as CREAM on top of cold or hot cobbler. I&#39;m guessing it is poured on as desired.  It quite easily could be replaced with ice cream or a whipped topping.  Hope this helps.

Not too sweet, peaches soaked up all the good flavor, sauce thickened/reduced to jelly like consistency.

I used 3 fresh peaches, peeled/sliced and added 3/4 cup of fresh blueberries. Upon reading the reviews I decided to go with my own topping recipe.... I used a half stick of butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a splash of milk. It made a saucy caramel. I drizzled half of it over the batter and baked it at 400 for appx. 30 min.

I recieved requests for the recipe.  I used an extra 1/2 cup of marshmallows, but other than that, I did not alter the ingredients.  However, if you truly use a pan with an interior measurement of 15 x 10, you will need a couple of extra graham crackers (trim with a knife) to fill the small gap at the bottom of pan.  Fill the pan so the graham crackers don&#39;t shift around during baking. As another reviewer suggested, make sure there is an overhang of foil on the short ends for removal from pan, spray the foil with nonstick spray, and do not overcook the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture (only a minute after the butter is melted and sugar is incorporated into the butter).  Watch the baking time carefully after the 12 minute mark.  At 12 minutes, mine had browned only at the edges and not in the middle.  Try to get to an overall golden brown without letting the outside edges get too overdone.  I let it cool for about 15 min and then removed it from the pan by holding the 2 ends of the foil.  I let it cool completely and then cut as directed with a sharp knife.  The pizza cutter idea didn&#39;t work well for me.  I will absolutely make this again."

First and foremost, if you follow my recommendations, you will not have any problems at all, despite what others say here.  What I did is use Reynolds (brand) Release Foil (make sure dull side is facing up) in the 10X15X1 pan.  MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH FOIL HANGING OVER THE SHORT ENDS TO LIFT THE COOKIES OUT OF THE PAN LATER.  I ALSO sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray very lightly.  I made sure all of the graham crackers fit properly in the pan (trim using a paring knife if need be--it&#39;s much easier than you think).  Once the crackers are in the pan properly, I did use more than two cups of mini marshmallows...probably 2-1/2 cups total--enough to cover all of the crackers sufficiently.  Then what I did is I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of light brown (not dark brown) sugar.  Make sure you use real butter and fresh brown sugar.  I cooked it precisely 1 minute after the butter melted.  I think what a lot of cooks are doing is cooking the butter and brown sugar mixture too long.  This will cause the cookies to not turn out like they are supposed to (I know from experience).  I used 1-1/2 teaspoons of GOOD cinnamon (like Penzey&#39;s Celyon) and good, double strength vanilla extract.  I also put a PINCH (no more) of salt in the caramel mixture.  When it is cooked, I transferred the entire caramel mixture into a Pyrex measuring cup and poured it very carefully over the marshmallows so nothing puddled.  Then I topped with the coconut and almonds and baked for 12 minutes and then checked it.  My oven tends to be a bit psychotic, so it only takes about one minute more in mine to brown.  When you take the cookies out of the oven, you will see that the marshmallows look like they are not cooked all the way.  Don&#39;t worry.  They will finish melting when you take them out of the oven.  Remove pan from oven and place on a towel on table or counter for five minutes.  Then lift cookies out by short ends with the foil overhang and place back on table or counter for five minutes or so (depends on temperature in your house at the time).  Then lightly spray a large pizza cutter with nonstick spray and use the pizza cutter to slice through the cookies--don&#39;t remove from pan right away--just slice.  Then let cool completely and put in a very loosely covered container.  They won&#39;t last long enough to go stale.  Not to worry.  People are having problems with these cookies because, I think, they are cooking the caramel way too long.  Even a minute too long is tooo long.  I hope this helps you guys so that you will try it--even try it again, if you didn&#39;t like the way they turned out the first time.  Happy baking!"

I had to put 2 of them in a pan all by themselves, which turned out to be a happy accident because it left more space around them for the sauce to caramelize so when you cut to separate them, more of the thin, crispy-chewy sauce stuck around the edges.

Leave out the onion in the butter sauce topper and use sesame seeds to differentiate between the two versions.  Both are huge hits!  Be sure to cut the ham and cheese to &#34;roll size&#34; before you put them together as it mskes them so much easier to cut for serving after they&#39;re baked.

I also could only let them sit in the fridge for about an hour before we needed to eat lunch that day. My teenage daughter who is THE pickiest eater on planet Earth loved them. Tomorrow night I am making a double batch of the sauce and pouring it over baked chicken breasts for a quick and easy dinner.

I did tweak the recipe, in part because of personal preference but also because I used what I had on hand. I used about 4lbs of boneless skinless thighs. Following the advice of other reviewers, I used brown sugar instead of white. I also added honey and grated some ginger into the mixture. I substituted rice vinegar for apple cider vinegar and cooked on low in the crockpot for just under 3 hours.  Also, I found that I needed to double the cornstarch mixture at the end to get a good thickness. Served over quinoa and steamed broccoli and it was a big hit."

First as for taste, it is good but for my family possibly too sweet.  For clarity, I did take the advice of other reviewers and use light brown sugar instead of white which I think is essential if you want a true teriyaki flavor.  However, the sugar definitely needs to be adjusted and cut down.  Second, I also had the same problem as other reviewers in not being able to get the sauce to properly thicken as expected.  There was just too much of if and I used a little over three pounds of chicken thighs.  I served it with rice and there was PLENTY of sauce to go round and then some!  Finally, the cook time is way off.  Luckily I had read the reviews and noted this issue.  My chicken was done at 3 hours so I moved the crock-pot setting over to warm.  If you cook this the full time stated in the recipe you will get over-done dry chicken.  As I mentioned, this recipe as potential but could use some tweaking."

I didn&#39;t use my crockpot because it over cooks the chicken.  I browned the chicken in a little olive oil, then I drained the grease and cooked the chicken in the sauce until done.

Served with rice and passed the sauce--YUMMY!  I made a little extra sauce because I cooked a little more than 3 lbs. of chicken (using a 5 qt. slow cooker).  It didn&#39;t go to waste.  My son used it over the next few days with leftovers and with other things he made for himself.  It&#39;s very good teriyaki sauce.

I read previous reviews before trying this one. The problem with a lot of recipes is lack of details. Have your marshmallow creme jar open, and your peanut butter - I used Jif No Stir Natural Creamy Peanut Butter. already measured out. Prep your pan before you start. I line a 7&#34;x10&#34; glass pan lined with parchment. You must first bring the milk (I used evaporated milk) and sugar to a full boil - one that does not go away when stirred. I usually start with medium-high to get the boil going, then back off to medium once it&#39;s boiling.  You must stir constantly. Begin your 3 minute timing once the mixture comes to a full boil. Take the pan off the heat! I immediately stirred in a tsp of vanilla. Now you&#39;ve got to work quickly. Add your peanut butter and marshmallow creme.  Stir with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined. Pour into your prepared pan. Let it cool completely at room temperature. To cut it, just lift it our with the parchment paper and place it on your cutting surface. Cut into 1&#34; squares because it&#39;s quite rich. LOVE this recipe! Plenty of peanut butter flavor for me."

I changed when I started timing my boil time the second time and the fudge was perfect.When you time for the 3 minutes DO NOT start timing at a full boil. I did this the first time and my fudge was very dry and crumbly.Start timing for your 3 minutes as soon as it starts to boil. I removed from heat after the 3 minutes of boil before I added the marshmallow fluff and peanut butter.I only had a 13 oz jar of fluff and measuring out 7 oz was  a pain. I highly suggest buying the 7 oz jar if possible.Good luck!

Maybe it is because I too am from Indiana.  maybe because both sides of my family in a weird way are Wrights! Maybe that is why I liked it. Too I miss my grandparents and my mom. Probably the taste buds in the mid-west are far different than other regions. If you&#39;re concerned about soybean oil then I know there are other mayo&#39;s you buy. Or make your mayo from scratch. I find it unfair that someone would call this a loser or anyone&#39;s recipe a loser. Just simply state that if it was not for your taste buds instead of insulting someone&#39;s recipe. That might have hurt their feelings. I frankly thought when I saw that...I will not dare share any of my families recipes because of how insulting people can be. In this day."

I also use the spices to taste  -  that&#39;s not nearly enough salt and pepper.  My mom always added a dash of nutmeg to her potato salad and I do too.  It adds just a little different flavor but don&#39;t use too much - just a dash or two (maybe equals about 1/8 tsp or so).  I know a dash is different for everyone!  If I&#39;m feeling lazy or don&#39;t have a lot of time, I sometimes add the pre-cooked bacon bits.  This is very similar to the kind we grew up with."

I use 1/2 tsp of fresh coarse ground black pepper instead 1/4 tsp. Also I add 5 leaves of Romaine lettuce, ribs removed, chopped to about the size of a quarter and 1 or 2, depending on the size, diced Hass avocados and a good full cup of grated sharp Cheddar cheese. Also I use the whole pkg of elbow macaroni. The mayo I use is my own home made, from an old Wesson oil recipe for mayo that came out in the 1930s. We love this salad but it certainly does not make 12 servings unless you&#39;re the food police. We like having some left over to snack on later."

I had a few items I needed to use up in the fridge, so I added a partial red pepper &amp; green pepper in addition to the veggies listed in the recipe. I put 1/2 cup of Gorgonzola cheese and it was a perfectly flavored salad to go with our BBQ chicken.

My husband actually asks me to make batch for the house and the bbq so he can have some when he wants a snack later because he knows it will be gone before we get home. I have even have people complain that I did not make enough because it is gone before they can even dish their plate at the bbqs. It is a keeper!!!!!!!!! I did not put celery in it or the pepper.

However, it has WAY too much sugar in it for me.  I doubled the recipe to make it the same as my regular pancake recipe--meaning it now calls for 2/3 cup sugar!  My normal pancake recipe only has 2 tablespoons of sugar for the same amount of flour/oats.  Because we use syrup on our pancakes I don&#39;t feel like I need my pancakes to be sweet too--its just added sugar that is unnecessary.  So, next time I will reduce the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a delicious recipe.

I added a small scoop of applesauce after reading all the reviews that talked about such thick batter.  My batter wasn&#39;t thick at all but I also didn&#39;t have whole wheat flour and just used all regular gluten free flour.  That might have affected the thickness as well.  Plus I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and topped them with blueberries and raspberries. These were really wonderful.  Not as heavy as I thought people said in other reviews but definitely filling.  Really great recipe and definitely a family pleaser.

We only have regular oats because we eat oatmeal and reg. tastes better but worked fine-I soaked the oats for 10-15 mins in the buttermilk while I mixed dry ingred. and cooked sausage. had to add another tbl or so of milk after combining all ingred. one note: they don’t really bubble to indicate ”turn now” by time they really bubble, too done, so check early on!"

Also I didn’t want to wash my 1/3 cup so I eyeballed the brown sugar. I ended up leaving it in the mixing bowl to soften up the oats for Maybe 5-10 minutes while I started coffee and then threw that batter on a griddle, cooked those puppies up, and inhaled 3 while they were still warm and covered in smashed strawberries and blackberries. The recipe made 9 good-sized pancakes that were soft, fluffy, and tasted a little like banana bread. I’m sold."

Too sweet for me which I&#39;m pretty sure is the first time I&#39;ve ever said that!  It is tasty  though. I cooked on a low heat but the pancakes stuck to the nonstick griddle because of the high amount of sugar.   If I made again I would reduce the sugar. On the flip side (see what I did there) you don&#39;t need much syrup or jam to top them.

When I read the ingredients it sounded like nothing I ever tried so I wanted to review it for sure. I was expecting them to be really sweet but they weren&#39;t at all. The batter was much thicker than I am used to but that was just fine. I didn&#39;t have whole wheat flour so I just used regular and I had no buttermilk so I used what I had in the fridge. The only thing I would edit about the directions for this recipe is you should have a cooking temp on there because I didn&#39;t realize that they should be cooked at a lower temp because of how thick and it seems a few others had that issue as well. If someone would like thinner pancakes they could easily just add more milk until the get the right consistency for them. Great recipe really nice job I will make it again for sure. Thanks for sharing!

I&#39;ve begun adding a chopped apple and a handful of chopped walnuts to the batter - takes it up another notch.  Because this batter is so thick, I cook them at a slightly lower temp on the griddle - otherwise they tend to get overly brown on the outside before the inside is done.  I use buttermilk powder - stirring the powder in with the dry ingredients and using 1 cup of water with the other wet ingredients (egg and oil). As long as I have all of the ingredients on the counter, I make up several batches of the dry ingredients in zipper bags and store them in the refrigerator.  Makes a really quick and easy meal any time of the day!!"

When I saw this recipe (we love pancakes) I decided to make them, BUT I did make a few changes.  I replaced the whole wheat flour with white whole wheat, which is not as bitter as whole wheat flour and the brown sugar with a Tablespoon of Agave syrup (which gave it a little more moisture).  I also  replaced the vegetable oil with the same amount of extra light olive oil and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  The pancakes - YUM !!!!!!!   You could  also replace the brown sugar with a tablespoon of pure maple syrup which would give it a little more brown sugar taste.  I never use whole wheat flour anymore, I strictly use the white whole wheat which can be used in recipes calling for whole wheat flour."

They were the lightest and most flavorful pancakes I&#39;ve ever seen.  The wonderful nutty sweet flavor is sadly hidden when you add the syrup (although you don&#39;t need much) and butter.I got 7 pancakes from the recipe using the 1/3 c. measure.  I didn&#39;t have wheat flour so made them with 1 c. all-purpose flour and it worked fine.  I read a review about the cakes being dry.  That is my thought on using wheat flour.  I have never made anything with it that hasn&#39;t turned out terrible dry so I&#39;m wondering if her cakes were dry from the wheat flour and not the oatmeal.Here is something I tried for the first time and I was amazed.  I never buy buttermilk so was reading the other day to see if my method of adding 1 T. lemon juice to 1 c. of milk is a close substitute.  The article said that it is fine but sometimes will give off the taste of the lemon.  They suggested the closest sub to buttermilk is to add 1-1/2 tsp. cream of tartar to the dry ingredients for very cup of milk.  They said it is very hard to find any differences in using that compared to products made with buttermilk.  Maybe that&#39;s why they were so light they nearly floated off the plate!

I thought the oatmeal seemed a little dry in them, so next time I might add a little more milk and let them sit a few minutes before cooking them.       Update- I have found that if I let the batter sit for a few minutes before making them that the oatmeal is no longer dry in the pancakes and they are perfect!

I cooked it for 5 hours, shredded the chicken and added in the salsa and corn, then only cooked it all for an additional 15 minutes or so while my sides finished cooking.  The chicken was perfect.  I could actually taste the lime, but it wasn&#39;t overpowering.  I will be doing the same ratio next time.

The only suggestion I have is to heat it longer than 30mins.  The finished product made a lot.  Was a bit drippy but was still very good.  Had plenty leftover meat mixture and used it for lunch the following date and crushed up some organic blue tortilla chips and mixed in with it.  Super yummy that way too!

The beauty of this recipe is it is delicious as is, but is also adaptable.  We, like so many others, begin with this basic recipe and enhance it to meet our specific tastes by sauteeing onions, carrots, celery, baby spinach, one minced clove of garlic, 1/8 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and one tablespoon of Madeira wine with the mushrooms before blending everything.   Before adding the cream, I put half of the blended mix into a freezer container and allow it to cool completely before freezing.

I just wanted to make a comment in response to the information you shared about stock vs broth. I’m not sure what you’ve shared is accurate. It’s my understanding that both stock and broth are made from the bones, the difference is in the length of time they are cooked. Bone broth is cooked longer with the intention of leeching more nutrients from the bones. Chicken stock is more for flavour, where as broth is more for health benefits. I’m open to being challenged on this, just wanted to put forth a different perspective. Thanks."

My hubby needed something hearty but liquid and this did the trick.    I did read through the comments and did some changes.   First I started with crimini mushrooms.   When the onions and mushrooms were cooked I added crushed roasted garlic and dried thyme.   I also added a splash (1/4 cup) of sherry to the broth.    Let it boil for about 15min then added whipping cream, some more butter,  another &#34;splash&#34; of sherry and some fresh lemon juice.   Shimmered for about 1/2hr.  Pulled out a 1/2 cup of mushrooms,  then used the immersion blender to what it was in the pot.   Added back the mushrooms set aside.   Did add just a little cornstarch to thicken it a little bit more.   The extra cooking allowed the flavor to developed.  Definitely a keeper recipe."

Doubled the recipe (meaning I doubled almost* every ingredient) because 1) hubby loves cream of mushroom soup, and 2) I had a lot of mushrooms I needed to use. *The only ingredient I didn&#39;t double was the flour. I also added cooking sherry (which works just fine).  I used 4 tbsp. butter, melted. Then added the onion and cooked for about 5 minutes. Then, the flour which I quickly stirred so it was almost a roux, but it was very dry, so that&#39;s when I tossed in about 1 tsp. or so of cooking sherry. Next I added 29 oz. of chicken broth (mixed of Swanson&#39;s organic and some homemade leftovers) and the mushrooms. I added some thyme because, in my world, pretty much every mushroom dish is a little bit better with thyme (for this I added about 1 tsp.) Then I let it simmer until the onions and mushrooms were soft. NOTE: I did NOT add salt.  When the onions and mushrooms were soft, I added a bit of the broth to a combo of 1/2 c. half"

I did this for use in casseroles and the consistency is great. Next time I might add another tablespoon or 2 of flour to make it thicker, or reduce the liquid. Make sure you wisk the flour into the stock really well before adding it to pot, and boil for a full 2-3 minutes to cook out the flour taste.

I came back here to get a reminder of how to make it, and half-and-half is on the recipe. Doubted my memory and used the half and half. It was so unremarkably bland and THIN. Heavy Cream makes all the difference in the world. Possibly this recipe was tweaked since I saved it? Would rate it 3 stars as-is. Fine for a way to use up mushrooms, but nothing I would serve for a special meal. Use the original heavy cream if you want 5 stars.(previous review) I am trying to let the soup finish cooking, but can&#39;t help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove. I think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right. The mushrooms can&#39;t be plain white mushrooms. Their flavor is half the taste. I used CRIMan but would have loved to use portabella/baby bellas. I also used sweet onions. (Peruvian) I cannot imagine using white or yellow with this. admittedly I fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole, and it has plenty of onion flavor in it. Also, at the suggestion of a friend, I added a roux. Accidently made it very dark, but the toasted flavor was perfect. my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so I omitted salt and pepper. Simply amazing."

I did not have any cream only skim milk, and it came out really good for my taste, it had a nice creamy texture, cream may be too heavy for me.  I also had a cooked chicken breast and cut that up and put in as well.  I also used Mrs Dash Onion in it for a little kick.

This time I chopped up a half pound of shrimp, cooked a package of shrimp-flavored ramen noodles and instead of putting together the spice mix used the seasoning packet from the ramen (I was inspired by Lillie583’s idea).

I now keep rice noodles on hand just for this recipe. I also save some time by browning a full pound of ground pork ahead of time in the sesame oil, separating it into two 1/2-pound packages and freezing it (just remember to label the package so as to not confuse it for browned ground beef). This dish goes together so quickly with these short cut hacks and you have a delicious alternative to time-consuming conventional egg rolls. Delicious flavor!!"

I make it using shredded coleslaw rather than chop up a head of cabbage.  We also use gluten free noodles and gluten free soy sauce so my 10 year old granddaughter with diet restrictions can eat it.  (I tried using the angel hair type rice noodles and prefer it with a firmer noodle.)   I added two slightly beaten eggs to the cooked pork and cabbage for a reason.  Years ago I made egg rolls for Asian friends and they told me I forgot to add the egg.  Adding the egg does not alter the taste of the egg roll noodle bowl ingredients.

Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, this recipe is just for the inside of an egg roll.  If you normally dip your egg roll in soy sauce, you&#39;ll want to add extra soy sauce to this.  I used finely shredded cabbage that came in a bag and put several baby carrots in a food processor for the shredded carrots.  I did the full amount for everything, but only did 3C finely shredded cabbage and 1C processed carrots.  This was because when I was putting them into the pan, these amounts alone looked like a LOT.  I couldn&#39;t imagine adding more.  I also did regular yellow onion, not green.  I thought the ratio of veggies/meat/noodles seemed pretty good too.

I initially thought the ingredients did not allow for enough &#39;sauce&#39; but it is so flavorful and it was indeed enough. I did, however, deglaze the pan after cooking the pork with about 1/4 cup of chicken stock because the spices got concentrated on the bottom of the pan. That didn&#39;t create more &#39;sauce&#39; because it evaporated - just wanted to get the good bits off the bottom of the pan. But that  I used leftover pork roast (cubed up) instead of ground pork. I also used more liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce and added another tablespoon (it needed more of that ingredient in my mind). Next time I make it I will probably use 2 oz. of the noodles instead of 4 (just personal preference - I would like more cabbage ratio than noodle). I did add one egg towards the end and scrambled it in the pan - didn&#39;t need it necessarily but I liked the added richness it provided. I added some chopped cilantro on top as I served it. This is a keeper and for me that&#39;s a big deal. I rarely go by recipes but I followed this one to the &#34;T&#34; and it was great."

This reminded my husband of his favorite dish at a fast food noodle restaurant. I liked it because I could control the ingredients and the cost per serving was a fraction of the restaurant price! The only changes I made were to add a bit more soy sauce to suit our tastes, and to use sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of ground pork. I think you could use any protein and get a great result. This has been declared a top 5 favorite meal in our house!"

Try reducing the water by a quarter cup or the strawberries by a quarter cup. Some experimenting may be needed to get the proper ratio.

Looks like I&#39;ll be carrying on the tradition now.

Made it in 2 8&#34; round cake pans-I had a hard time getting it baked all the way -had to keep adding extra time. The icing was not as thick as I would&#39;ve liked but didn&#39;t want to make it too sweet by adding more powdered sugar. This time I baked in 3 8&#34; pans and bake time was 18 min at 350 degrees. Used the recommended 2 oz of cream cheese and drained the pureed strawberries for icing-PERFECTION! Either was the cake is absolutely delicious! Kept in the refrigerator as a cool dessert with this hot summer heat. This is will definitely be in my recipe book for life!

The rim  of the pan was  also covered with batter which made removal from the pan difficult.   Followed the instructions exactly and didn&#39;t change a thing.  Think I&#39;ll cut back on the amount of strawberries in the frosting to avoid  a runny frosting.    It&#39;s for my grand daughter&#39;s birthday and I&#39;m hoping the frosting covers up the messy cake.

I made this as a birthday cake with an additional lemon cake layer per the request of my 17-year-old daughter.  Moist, homemade flavor even though it&#39;s from a box and has flavored gelatin. I was skeptical, but now throughly impressed. It was a real hit! I use a good avocado oil for baking instead of canola or veg oil. I used a food chopper to chop  strawberries. They were perfect! Not too fine and not too big. I used the frosting recipe - ingredients only but with different measurements, plus added cream cheese to it and made it as a filling between the layers ( not nearly as sweet that way, as others had mentioned), and frosted with White icing.  I tripled  this recipe and baked it in a 12 x 12 x 2 pan.  Only used about 2 1/2 of the recipes  instead of the full tripled amount to fill the pan.  It came out perfect!   I used  nonstick spray on pan as well as the parchment paper and sprayed paper. Do not let cake cool completely in pan. Only cool cake about 10-15 min on a cooling rack.  Took a knife and wen along the edges of the pan to release any possibly stuck sides. I noticed that the gelatin with the sugar may stick a little bit, but it&#39;s not bad. Then placed another piece of parchment paper on the top of the cake, placed cooling rack on top of the cake and while holding both cooling rack and pan flipped cake over and let it sit for a moment. Shook gently. Removed pan. Nothing stuck!  Just a thought, but  usually can&#39;t go wrong when a cake recipe begins with Mamaw."

I made a 13 * 9  and baked it about 26 minutes.  The only change I made was to the frosting. I used mashed strawberries In a heavy syrup instead of crushed fresh strawberries. I wanted more strawberry flavor and this was perfect.  Creamed the butter and a tablespoon of the strawberries then beat in powdered sugar.  Added small amounts of strawberries until i got the  right consistency desired.  Served the cake with a really good vanilla ice cream and dribbled a little of the remaining strawberry syrup concoction over the top. People made themselves miserable with second servings.

It was called Strawberry Jello Cake.  Used no sugar or flour.  Just cake mix, strawberry jello, 3 eggs, oil, water and 10 oz bag of frozen strawberries.  Separate strawberries from juice (save juice for glaze).  Baked in 13 x 9 pan.   For glaze, 1 16 oz bag powdered sugar, little melted butter and strawberry juice.  Mix and pour over cooled cake.  Take a fork and poke cake all over before pouring glaze."

I used 2 egg whites, rather than the 2 eggs. I also baked this in 2 greased and floured 8&#34; square pans for 35 minutes-I used a cake tester to determine whether the cakes were done!  I&#39;d used 3 Tbsp. of the cake mixture to mix in with the chopped strawberries.  Instead of using a strawberry icing, I used 2 cups of confectioners&#39; sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice (bottled) and the 1/2 cup crushedstrawberries.  I&#39;d pricked holes in each cake with a fork and then drizzled the glaze over each cake.  The cakes certainly ARE moist! The feedback on this cake from other readers is also VERY helpful! I think that if I made the icing again, I will concentrate on that! I&#39;ve made cakes using Jello and I often resort to making a lemon glaze or other citrus-type glaze which runs down into the baked cake, making it extra moist!  When I added the water in the amount specified, I added it slowly to the batter! delowenstein"
