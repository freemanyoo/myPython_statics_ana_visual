Mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin.  I did set out the 2 creams when i first started the dish so they wouldn&#39;t be so cold.

This was Good! I did change/add quite a bit, but my favorite too to share is this: I saw a lot of people thickening with flour and gagged a little, lol! As a southern cook, my grandma taught me long ago to slowly sprinkle in instant mashed potatoe flakes to soups, etc! You don&#39;t taste the potato, it thickens Instantly and No Lumps!! Anyway... here&#39;s my other many, many tweaks: I used a cold store-bought chicken and sauteed a large, chopped Vidalia onion, half of a chopped red bell pepper, and added fresh, minced garlic to the veggies once they were softened. I didn&#39;t have green chiles, so I added two (Drained!!!) cans of Diced tomatoes with green chiles (one mild and one &#34;Mexican&#34; flavored, YUM!) Also, I had 2 cans of Canellini beans (white kidney beans) instead of great northern. As far as spice... I doubled or tripled the cumin- we like that flavor a LOT- and added a few handfuls of chopped cilantro. Also I seasoned the sauteing veg mix with the yellow Adobo and the Sazon Completa seasonings. Served this with chips, Monterey Jack cheese, guacamole and LOTS more fresh cilantro! So good but...sorry this was so long!"

If you like really thick chili, I would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour cream/whipping cream a bit (and maybe the cayenne pepper too then) or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned, but we thought it was really good as written! Just the right spiciness- I can&#39;t tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little &#39;bite&#39; in your mouth after eating it.

I adjusted this recipe slightly, based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I added 1/2 t. poultry seasoning (in place of Oregano). Used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I only had one can of chopped green chilies, so added a cup of chopped red, yellow and orange bell pepper. We like heat, so I used 1T of cayenne, and we added sliced jalape?o peppers and shredded cheese on top, forgoing the sour cream.  I used 2 c. of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and 2 T corn starch as a thickener.  There are so many ways to make white chili, that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning, based on the preferences of those you are feeding, you&#39;ve got a hit every time.  Our side was a handful of gluten free corn chips, but sweet cornbread would be perfect too."

I did make a few minor changes to adapt to my daughter&#39;s taste while keeping the essence and taste of the recipe in tact.I took a note from &#34;purplepentacle&#34; using fresh garlic along with toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds.My daughters do not like green chilies so I reduced it to one can. They also love the taste but not the texture of onions; because of this after sauteing the onion and garlic I pureed them along with the green chilies.We love cilantro and use it in most of my soups, so I doubled the amount used.I added 1/4 cup of rice. My daughter doesn&#39;t like the consistency of chili, so because of this and the addition of the rice, I used 48 ounces of broth; this gave it a chowder consistency.To make it healthier I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt rather than sour cream.I was in a hurry so I used a store bought roasted chicken. I added a splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34; of the chicken.I served it in small bread bowls. It was very stick to your ribs and is now a favorite."

I made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe.  First of all my daughters do not care for green chilies, so I used only one can. I also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic. My daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture.  Secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro, I use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups; so in this case I doubled the amount of cilantro. Additionally I added a quarter cup of rice. My oldest doesn&#39;t like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice I used a 48 ounce box of broth. This gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved. I used precooked roasted chicken so I added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34;.  Lastly to make it healthier I swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. All of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter."

Even though there were 9 soups, and it made a large crock pot full! I mixed the everything together, including the cream and sour cream before cooking in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. It turned out wonderful. I also only added 3 cans green chiles (1 1/2 the recipe instead of double) just so it wouldn&#39;t be too hot. Next time I will add all 4 cans because although it had a kick, it wasn&#39;t as much as I like. I also did as others have recommended and used instant potato flakes to make it creamier.

I live in FL and I have been collecting fresh mangoes every day on my way to work. I only had one ripe banana and a plethora of ripe ripe mangoes, so I did 114g of ripe banana puree and 114g of fresh mango puree. It turned out super tasty with gorgeous hues. I divided the batter into 4 mini loaves and baked for 40-45 minutes in my mini bread stone pan (until the toothpick came out clean). This way I was able to share the love a little further and pass out mini loaves to my co-workers, neighboors, and friends."

My family and neighbors like it.  At 350 it always burns the bottom and the ends. Today I was determined to get a good one.  I started at 350 but after reading some reviews lowered the temperature to 325. That made a nice banana bread not burnt.  The bread bakes dark.  Also I baked it for 1 hr 10 min. Given how many people have the burnt ends I think Taste of Home should make a correction or a comment.

I used organic coconut oil instead, plus about a tablespoon of butter.  2) I used 1/2 cup of sugar and used 3 large overripe bananas instead of two (I didn&#39;t measure but it was probably more than the 1 cup of bananas called for in the recipe). In addition, because of the extra banana, I was able to cut the eggs down to one but I did use  a large egg.I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, as my family likes that, but they aren&#39;t necessary as I tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet.  I wasn&#39;t sure about baking it at 325 degrees...so halfway through I upped it to 350 degrees.  I don&#39;t think it made any difference...but I do have a convection oven."

LOL  I am going to tell you that I *LOVE* this recipe, although the version that I was given does NOT use the buttermilk, walnuts or vanilla, uses 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder. and reduces the sugar to 3/4 cup, all else is the same (I *know*, it&#39;s NOT THE SAME, right!?!?!).  I *do* love nuts in my banana bread, and I *have* added them in the past.

My husband has hated every recipe I have made and only likes his grandmas. I got his grandmas recipe and made it. And guess what? Did it turn out like grandmas? No. I tried this recipe last night. I used 3/4 of the all mixed, finished batter and put hat into a  loaf pan. The remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins. I did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs. This recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans. But my sister swore by this. No the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked. This was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan. I sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist. Most breads come out too dry when I use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time. My sister was right. Thanks sis! The bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this AMAZING recipe.

BRILLIANT!! and though I&#39;m not used to the US Electric Fahrenheit 325&#39;F measure i just converted it to Centigrade 160-165&#39;C (in the UK I would use a Gas Oven GAS MARK 3) .  On with my version of the cake...  As one of my son prefers chocolate cake and hubby always likes nuts of some type in his cake, I too added cinnamon &amp; sliced my bananas to save extra washing up dishes but then added chocolate fondant, Walnuts and Cadbury&#39;s Drinking Chocolate (i reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup due to the sugar in the fondant (i had no chocolate in the cupboards) added a little milk (approx a quarter cup) and a drop more oil to keep the cake moist) it turned out fine, not quite as moist and squidgy as the usual banana chocolate cake you&#39;d expect but whoever tasted it say its perfectly fine.

The 1st time I tried the recipe I used an 11 cup pyrex dish as I saw that it made a really big loaf. I started to moniter the baking process at approx. 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick. This time I doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before, except I used only 3 bananas (only had that many) and baked in a 13 x 9. I also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting.

HOT and yummy!Pros- moist and baked through. I was really worried about putting it all in one pan, because I hate partially cooked banana bread. This was banana bread, not pudding, and I liked very much. Great flavor.  However, I did cut back on the sugar (only 3/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white) and substituted applesauce for oil. Didn&#39;t have buttermilk onhand so I just used milk and put some butter in for flavor. My dd and I are more than happy with the result.Raised up to a beautiful loaf of bread.  I don&#39;t know if it helped that I whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure I didn&#39;t have banana globs. I will continue to do that.Cons- considering how sweet it is, I would not follow the recipe sugar recommendation.Bake time for my loaf was too long, and I only had it in for 50 minutes. I was glad it was baked through, but if this had been for gifts, I would not have shared.  The ends will be way too tough and overdone. It is very tough about a half to an inch around.

The brown sugar gave it a nice darker color and a chewier crust- which I like.  I used Jumbo eggs and Vanilla Bean Paste.

Just a couple things that you need to know.  The bake time at the top says 70 mins and in the recipe itself it says 1 hr 20 mins or until the tooth pick comes out clean.  I have made this 3 times and it takes about 60 mins at the most at 325 degrees.  Let the bread rest in the pan for 5-10 mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack.  The bottom tends to stick a little when using a spray so use shortening or butter to grease the pan.

I doubled the recipe and left out the nuts.  I used a couple of silicon loaf pans and the edges of the bread were a little dark. I should have maybe knocked the temp down a little to compensate for the dark pan or checked it a little earlier for doneness.  Overall though, the bread turned out very nicely.  I have another 8 bananas on the brink so I&#39;ll make a couple more double batches and work out my flaws. I&#39;ll go get some buttermilk too as I would like to see how that would change the flavor.  I imagine that this will be my go-to banana bread recipe in the future.  thanks!"

And the reason I like it so much is that it is much lower in fat than the old family version.   For having only 1/2 cup of oil, in what turns out to be a very large loaf, I thought this was an exceptionally moist and flavorful bread.    I used 3 bananas instead of 2 since it was suggested by so many other reviewers.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly skipping only the nut since my family doesn&#39;t care for them.  Mine actually tested done after 1 hr and 10 mins.   The outer crust was slightly crunchy but not hard.    Will definitely keep this recipe and make it again."

I exchanged white sugar for raw, organic cane sugar and used 1/4 cup less sugar.  I also used organic bananas that were very ripe and organic eggs.

I mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth.  It smelled so good while it was cooking!!

I usually make it a few times a month in the fall and winter as it is one of the few meals that everyone in my family will eat.  I’ve adapted it a little to suit my family’s tastes.  I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddars instead of Velveeta, and I use a combination of peeled russet (all purpose) potatoes and unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes as I like the different textures.  Sour cream is not something that I keep on hand, so I rarely add it in.  We drink fat free milk, so I often use that instead of buying whole milk  just for using in this recipe.   To change things up from time to time, in place of ground beef, I’ve used both ground and link sausages (sliced thin) and cubed ham.  I’ve also left the meat out altogether and doubled the potatoes.  When using ground meat, I typically use a whole pound instead of a half pound.  Any way I make it, we like to sprinkle some bacon on top!  Enjoy!"

Pretty much followed the directions except I used the white queso Velveeta instead of the regular. My husband went back for 3rds!

Joanie, thank you for sharing your recipe. I wanted something quick, easy, a soup, and something that would use the 1lb of ground beef I had thawing in the refrigerator for dinner. My husband is on a low FODMAP diet per his GI Dr. So I omitted the onion as that&#39;s high in FODMAPs and I added half the Velvetta cheese and substituted the rest with Cheddar Cheese. I also used beef stock vs chicken stock to amp up the beefiness. My husband loved it"

The mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup, but I did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product.  Solution, I pureed them once fully cooked with 1 cup of beef broth.  That is a second change I made, beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons.  For me, a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato, so that brought me to my third modification - 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices.  My fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef.  I also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup.  To keep the cooked ground beef moist &amp; tender, I did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done.  The mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup.  I used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted.  Rather than Velveeta, which contributes too much salt to the soup, I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 12 ounces of sharp cheddar (use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger).  The cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce, and made the sour cream unnecessary.  I finished with salt &amp; pepper to taste  along with a generous 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard.  After all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup (the tomatoes) and mustard?  While I made a number of changes that I prefer to this soup, I would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration."

He went back for seconds and ask on Sun. if there was any left that he could have for supper on Mon. night.  I didn&#39;t have basil or parsley so left out.  Used 8 oz. shredded Mexican chees and 8 oz. shredded co jack instead of Velveeta.  will be making this a lot this winter.    I used a full pound of hamb.  On Mon. I added a pint of home canned potato soup mix, a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls.  Potato soup mix is:  in a pint jar put  1/2 pint jar chopped potatoes, 1/4 pint sliced carrots, split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and fill with water.  Pressure can at 10 pounds for 20 minutes.  This makes a pretty jar for a gift also.  Put the instructions on it.To use heat soup mix with 1 Tablespoon butter or marg. and add one pint milk, check the salt and add pepper if you like.  Heat but don&#39;t boil.  If you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt. jar with 1 teaspoon of salt and pressure at 10 lbs. for 25 minutes.  You can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time.  These are handy to fry or add to soup."

That being said here&#39;s what I did: I put the onion, celery and carrots and 1 cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for 10 minutes.  I then added the potatoes, the rest of the broth, the basil and parsley and simmered for another 10 minutes, until the potatoes were done.  To thicken the soup, I then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the broth/veggies mix, stirring constantly.   I heated the milk and Velveeta in the microwave, stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted.  I added the cheese/milk mix after the potatoes were cooked.  I did not add any salt and I did not use the sour cream.  I ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and I served it in homemade bread bowls.   Very, very good!"

I&#39;ve tried it using frozen hash browns, but did not care for that flavor...some weird after taste. That said, it&#39;s a wonderful recipe written as is."

Like the others, I did make a few changes: Used a full pound+ of hamburger. Used Beef Broth (nearly 4 cups), not chicken broth. Used the pre-cooked frozen hash brown potatoes to save time. Added probably another cup of velveeta, plus a big handful of shredded chedder. CONS: Took at least an hour to cook with constant attention, it&#39;s not a quick meal. Even with the added beef, it barely served six of us (and that was with a homemade loaf of bread as a side for dipping.)"

I mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added 2 tbsp. of Dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel.

*EDIT 4/11/22*Made this tonight for dinner. We don&#39;t really care for Swiss cheese and we couldn&#39;t find Gruyere, so I subbed about 3/4 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano and I used scallions instead of white, sweet onion because they give egg dishes a metal taste. Didn&#39;t need, but a half of a teaspoon of kosher salt and about a teaspoon of white pepper. I also added some diced green pepper and we both loved it. Next time I will grate some fresh garlic and sauté the vegetables separately from the bacon. Delicious! Definitely a keeper!"

Put an over thermometer in to test what your actual temperature in there is and then you can adjust your temp accordingly.

Use a slightly larger casserole dish and do NOT use frozen anything. When the recipe states 3/4 cup - use 1 full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven. Also, the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish. We will place (lightly) a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first 30 minutes so it won&#39;t crust over too badly. PLUS, the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your family&#39;s tastes.  BUEN PROVECHO"

I&#39;ve been looking for a great breakfast casserole for years - and this is truly wonderful. I made it initially for a weekly teacher breakfast at my school.  I thought I had made too much - instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left!  My only complaint is that I found it to be just a little bland.  (The recipe calls for no additional spices...which I thought was sort of odd.)  I browned the hash browns (which takes forever, good lord), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  (I made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before I left for work - this also turned out quite well!)  The second time I made it (tonight), I added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture.  I also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and I love to the eggs and into the whole mixture.  (Just a few dribbles.)  I basically added blindly.  It turned out SO WELL.  Just gave it enough heat to be interesting, but not overpowering.  My hot sauce is not for the faint of heart...so if you&#39;re using something less insane like Frank&#39;s or Sriracha, you made need more.  Additionally, my Swiss cheese bag was 1 1/2 cups...I figured extra cheese makes everyone happier, and I just added all of it. :D I think there&#39;s a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy.  But seriously: MAKE THIS.  IT&#39;S DA BOMB."

My father in law and husband who are not fans of cottage cheese LOVED it and wouldn&#39;t have even known there was cottage cheese in there.  I have also used part skim cheese and it didn&#39;t make a significant difference just to make recipe lighter. I had a bag of potatoes to use up one time and chopped them into chunks and boiled them, drained, and used the recipe as is and they were delicious if you are looking to not use the frozen bag ones.Both ways are phenomenal but the skim substitutes makes per serving a bit lighter for those who are not looking for those who are watching their waist line =) excellent recipe and is a go to when I have a huge brunch and family visiting in town!"

I made this for supper for my adult son and I the other night. I had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title. I used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms from Costco - which I fried with the onions - in the same pan as I had fried the bacon (I used low sodium), separately. I added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper (my son loves it) but didn&#39;t add salt as I felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough. Seeing as I hadn&#39;t made this before I didn&#39;t make any other changes - unusual for me. It was a wholesome meal! I accompanied it with a dish of stewed, herb and spice whole tomatoes - but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available - I might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings. I will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes I make. Another reviewer&#39;s comment about using salsa is an option. Before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so I sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese. I was pleased with the result (I don&#39;t like food as hot/spicy as my son), and my son thought it was an improvement. He wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish - adding a bit more of both than I&#39;d put on the one I reheated. Obviously a personal preference. He also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies. I&#39;ll also add the whole 500g container of cottage cheese (that&#39;s 1/2 cup more than in this recipe), as we both love cheese.  Really pleased to find this recipe  - thanks Beth Notaro for sharing! It reminds me of an Old Order Mennonite friend I had who died too early a few years ago with cancer. I&#39;m sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be making this countless times with numerous variations - as well as ones close to the original. I like the idea that it&#39;s bread and gluten free as I have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten."

I didn&#39;t have Swiss cheese so I didn&#39;t use it and truth be told, we didn&#39;t miss it.  I think the extra cheese would have made it too rich and greasy.  I baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in my oven (likely due to the extra eggs).  The addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise, but I didn&#39;t even notice it was there.  If anything, it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry.  This is a great gluten-free recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread.

This is high on my list as the cottage cheese makes it so moist and delicious.I vary on the Cheddar cheese and use what I have on hand, sometimes I may add two or more different cheeses when I make a triple batch. I add different meats as well, to the casserole depending what is on sale at the store.  This is always a big hit with our parish of 45 people.We charge a $2.00 donation to cover the cost of the meal and what money is over the cost goes back to the Church.

My friend wanted a good seasonal cupcake recipe after she volunteered to bake desserts for another friend&#39;s November baby shower. I volunteered to help, and after baking a test batch, we made just a couple of alterations. For the &#34;pumpkin spice&#34; we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg, about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove, and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoon.For my palate, I&#39;d add even more spice in the future, likely the nutmeg and clove, but generally the spice level seems good for most people. I decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup, and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future, along with adding about 1/4 cup more cream cheese. We also added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a vanilla bean (split the bean and scrape out), along with the cinnamon, which made it a really rich tasting frosting.If you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way, and  the cupcakes look professionally made, nice to take to parties and holiday events. To top them off we sprinkled finely chopped candied ginger on top of the finished frosting."

Thus, the cupcakes didn&#39;t set fast enough in the oven and had &#34;hat brims&#34; of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice dome.I also made half of the frosting (as suggested by previous reviewers) and it covered all 30 (not 24 as the recipe claims) cupcakes nicely. The frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for (what I think is) a lot of cinnamon.As to why frosting might not be setting up (as mentioned by Alie0717): If you make cream cheese frosting with low-fat (Neufchatel cheese) or fat-free cream cheese, it doesn&#39;t have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting. Soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only full-fat or regular cream cheese. Remember, the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting."

So many recipes online these days are fails, but this worked perfectly!  For our family&#39;s preference, I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup.  The recipe still worked just fine with half the butter.  We also prefer a bit more seasoning, so I added a teaspoon of my poultry seasoning and some ground cayenne pepper, and snuck in a handful of julienned kale for a little extra nutrition. I&#39;m sure the seasoning in the recipe would be just fine as is though for most families.  The amount of filling this makes is plentiful - easily enough for two deep dish pie plates, but one could probably even do 3 shallow pie dishes.  I baked one pie and put the other in the freezer for another night.  My family loved this recipe.  Thank you for a reliable recipe that we will use again and again."

The only thing I changed (based on personal preference) I added 3 cloves of garlic and fresh thyme and rosemary from my Garden. I also only used 1 stick of butter.  Great recipe.

I omitted the corn but added celery everything else I include. I used canned chicken and used the broth from the cans for the gravy. I used a smaller rectangle dish than a 9 x13. it was 8 x 11.5.

It&#39;s classic and perfectly creamy..My boyfriend rates every recipe I try and this one he gave 11/10, and I agree!  I made some minor edjustments - I used the 3 cups of chicken stock to boil the carrots and potatoes, and reserved the liquid to add back in later. I only added 3/4 cup of flour instead of 1 cup. And I added 2 stalks of chopped celery when I added the onion to the pan. I made 1 pie last night,and froze the filling for a future pie.

I made half a recipe (more or less) in a 10” pie plate with my favorite crust recipe. I didn’t have thyme so I used poultry seasoning, The corn was canned because that’s what I had, and the carrots were leftover roasted. No peas since hubs really can’t stand them, so I threw in some leftover green beans instead. And I used a combination of skim milk and half&amp;half, because again, it’s what I had. Pandemic baking, as another reviewer noted. But it was creamy and delicious, and next time I will make extra and freeze. Yum!"

I half baked the bottom pastry before adding filling and top layer of pastry to ensure it wasn&#39;t under cooked. I use a square glass baking dish rubbed with a generous coating of butter.

I boiled my potatoes/carrots in chicken broth, then used the same broth to boil the cubes chicken meat breast and used the same broth for the gravy.

This is, by far, my favorite BASE recipe! I can never make a recipe without some augmentation to make it my own... mishpachah...like family, my Bubbe would say. I omitted the milk. I used a cup of homemade milk free gravy I had left from the meal for which I made the roast chicken we were using (leftovers) for this pie. I recently discovered, if done right, no milk is needed and creaminess survives! I also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid. In addition I added a Tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes. I made a homemade simple crust (ice water, butter, flour and salt) and brushed the top with yolk/water combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme. The cooking time was spot on, even here at high elevation in Colorado. I only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy, hearty, comforting goodness.

On the 1.5 cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it. This makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast. Next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or Velveeta cheese. Last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic, pressed. Put this in during sauce thickening. I sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting. He is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had. HE would not say that for fun. It&#39;s goooouooood!

The sauce was a stark white, tasteless paste that no amount of &#34;doctoring&#34; after the fact could resolve. A total waste of ingredients and home made pie crust. A much better option is to make your chicken stock ( or use store-bought stock ) and thicken it using 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water and simmer until it thickens before adding the chicken and vegetables. That way you still have chicken gravy not flour gravy."

I know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when I say I haven&#39;t made this exact recipe, but is is very close to one my mother, who was a fabulous cook, taught me years ago. I read a lot of the reviews, because there are so many, and I want to make comments based on what I read and my level of experience.  Because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe I would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments. If you&#39;re not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon - then sample it. Not enough, add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again. If you like that amount you don&#39;t need to add the full teaspoon. Flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients. Spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything. You will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences. AND - it does not mean the recipe is not great. The person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning - based on her family&#39;s taste buds but it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be adjusted to your own! The same goes for any other recipe. Have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go. Personalize to your heart&#39;s content! It really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they don&#39;t know how to make it more palatable. I do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had Home Economics classes in high school - though they didn&#39;t teach me much I hadn&#39;t learned at home. Cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues. Remember - add a pinch or so, sample and add more till it is to your taste. Baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent (as an example) to other dry ingredients and liquids used. Again, flavouring is a very personal matter. I would like to thank Karen Johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch, with no condensed soup and artificial flavours! To quote from a book called Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, I read in my early 20&#39;s &#34;Knowledge is communicable, wisdom is not.&#34; One of my Mom&#39;s favourites: &#34; We get too soon old and too late smart!&#34;"

I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Upon eating one bite, he says, &#34;this has to go into the rotation!&#34;. We both then devoured the tastiest chicken pot pie ever created. I did do a few things differently. I seared 5 chicken breast strips in vegetable oil  that I coated in garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I  was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish. I used one whole can of drained carrotts, and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for. After adding the cubed chicken I cooked prior, the recipe was still enough for 2 pies. I did not have 4 pie crusts so I used my largest round corningware casserole dish in place of a pie pan, which provided room for the entire mixture. It worked perfectly!

Substituted 12 oz package of mixed veggies for all other veggies -- will use more next time.  Used over-flowing 2 cups of rotisserie chicken along with &#34;jell&#34; from drippings in container.  Mixed everything together along with 1/2 cup of sour cream and placed in 11x7 casserole dish and topped with Parmesan cheese and then small cut-outs from pie crust.  Oh, used Thyme &#34;leaves&#34; and it was all wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again -- and probably in the very near future!"

Fresh thyme works best in my opinion..... especially if you can find lemon thyme. (It is easy to grow too. Best in 12x12 x12  inches deep pots and potting soil. Use started  small plants rather than seeds. So easy and cheaper in the long runI like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well. The only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand. I save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer.

I&#39;ve been wanting to make a pot pie for years; my grandma used to make them, but i dont have her recipe, so just beginning to experiment.   It was 10 degrees and snowing, so today was the day.I had to make it dairy-free, so substituted the butter with bacon fat, and just used a bit more broth, and the liquid from the corn (i used canned, not frozen), to replace the milk; total abot 4.5 cups liquid.   Next time I think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk; all we had in the fridge was almond milk, and I didn&#39;t think that would work well.I also cooked down some portobello &#39;shrooms  (about two cups before cooking) in the pan first, and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions.   I pretty much followed all the other measurements.  Oh, added a bit of ground clove, too.It was really great.  My two boys &amp; wife loved it; it was gone in minutes.  I made just one pie  (only had one box of crusts) in an extra deep 10&#34; stoneware pie pan, and still have enough filling left over for probably another small pie.  But tomorrow is another snow day, and I suspect the kids will warm it up and have it for breakfast.  That&#39;s how they roll."

For the baked chicken pie, my grandmother always added a few hard boiled eggs, diced.  Made the gravy silky and adds a extra punch.  She also made gravy on the side in the event someone wanted their&#39;s extra moist.  You cannot make and freeze these if you use hard boiled eggs.

First, I use only fresh veggies (except for the peas and pearl onions). It adds time but fresh carrots, parsnips, and Yukon Golds make a difference. Next, I add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute. To keep this flavorful I roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned. (Much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock, upping the flavor considerably.)  I also add a glug of sherry (or white wine, whichever is handy) to the simmering sauce.  Finally, I use the TOF site&#39;s buttery, flaky pie crust as the topper. It doesn&#39;t take long to make (and I only let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes) and is delicious on this pie. Yes, I&#39;ve increased the work and time but if you do, this is likely the best pot pie that&#39;s going to come out of your kitchen."

My best guess if you think it is too flour-y or too much thyme, then maybe try again because honestly I make these for anyone who is sick, birthdays, neighbors....and they rave constantly.  Maybe a misstep in the recipe was done.  The directions are correct and I like that they have the  frozen bake time! It is listed separate for easy understanding!  I love being able to have a frozen option such as this instead of soup/chili all the time."

My husband loved it.   The prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes, onions and carrots, count on prep time of  at least  1 1/2  hours.   If you buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco or another store , you   need to buy two chickens   for this recipe.  This recipe makes 2 LARGE pies.  It&#39;s enough, supposedly, to feed 16 people, but realistically 2 pies will feed about 8-10 adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie!  We are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie... it&#39;s so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner.   The diced potatoes get  &#34;lost&#34; in the pie- maybe I should cut them in larger pieces next time.    This would be a great hit for a pot luck."

I added another 1 tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasn&#39;t enough ( this took the flavor from just ok to yummy), and I was out of peas so I used cut green beans.  Prep time took me a little longer than I expected but was worth it in the end because I get two pies out of the deal.  I also ran short on crust (I had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie, so I only had 3 and needed 4), so instead of fully covering both pies, I just used cookie cutters on the 3rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes; kids loved it.  Filling comes out firm so it doesn&#39;t spill all over.  Also, even though boxed crust says to cook at 450, I did what the recipe said and did 425 for 35 mins (in gas oven) and it was perfect.

We have 6 children, so both pies would go in a single meal when all the kids were home!  Now I can usually freeze one for later--unless some of my sons find out I&#39;m making this &amp; decide to come home for supper that night!  I substitute 2 cups of frozen corn for the peas as my husband hates most vegetables.  I&#39;ve also made it with only the potatoes &amp; onions.  And, I use 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning instead of thyme because I don&#39;t like the flavor of thyme.  My youngest daughter made it on her own for her 13th birthday because I only had the use of one arm at that time--I talked her through it &amp; she was very proud of the compliments she received!"

I serve it &#39;bar&#39; style, I cut up tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, shredded cheese, guac, salsa, sour cream, etc and let everyone build their own fajita.

Rather than slicing and cooking chicken, peppers, and onions, I use Trader Joe’s 12oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen Fire Roasted Peppers &amp; Onions.  I just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe.  When the chicken is done marinating, I just heat up the peppers n onions for about 10 minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and it’s done and delicious.  I also use Trader Joe’s whole wheat low-carb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories.  Doing it this way, total prep and cook time is about 20 minutes, but if you don’t tell anyone they’ll think you actually worked hard making it.  I love cheating."

Time was limited, so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for 1-4 hours, as directed by the recipe. We still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful! So much so, that when making it again, we will not marinate the chicken, as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less time/planning ahead.  Otherwise, there is not a thing I would suggest differently. I just wanted to point this out because often times the &#34;set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours&#34; deters one from choosing a particular recipe. So, I want to make it known that if you&#39;re looking for THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS but in a pinch for time, that is not a reason to pass this one up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This was printed off and put into our family cook book, as we will be making this often. Thank you for sharing! ?"

Sometimes, we’ll mix the chicken, onions and peppers with beaten up eggs in a skillet and just scramble it all together.

First I added 1 Teaspoon each of ground cayenne, ground ancho chile, and ground chipotle chile.  This gave it a deeper smokie chili flavor without adding much heat.  Since a added more powders I also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste.  I pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them.  When cooking the  chicken I started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side, removed them and let them rest of 20 minutes.  This left the chicken with nice grill marks and raw in the center.  I then sliced them into even stips and finished the cooking with the vegatables.  By cooking the chicken twice I could control the timing of the fajitas for the party we were having."

But following this recipe and tweaking it to my liking, they were absolutely amazing! Even my mom enjoyed it, and she absolutely despises onions! They were 10x more delicious and flavourful than any fajita I&#39;ve had at a Mexican restaurant, and a huge improvement compared to our local one.  Personally, I used more lemon juice and a little less cummin. But since i like a little spice, I used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing. Fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too! I&#39;ve made it twice now and both times it&#39;s came out super delicious!"

Still came out amazing.  Family loved it!  It is definitely a keeper and a recipe worth repeating several times per year.  I actually turned on the broiler at the end, made up the fajitas by placing two tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil and preparing two large fajitas to go under the broiler, just until the cheese starts bubbling.  They added salsa and sour cream and wrapped them up.  Sauteing the vegetables in the remaining liquid left from cooking chicken is important.  Cooked until they appear burnt in spots. Incredible!"

The marinade is divine and packs a lot of flavor. I didnt let it sit for 24 hours. It was late so i let it sit for an hour and a half tops. That was all the time i needed. It was delicious. The marinade was so good that i could have eaten the chicken by itself. I&#39;ll will for sure be using this marinade for other recipes as well. My husband and son loved it.

Then I cook chicken after marinating for at least 1 hour.  Mix it all together and voila.  I love to cook all the time, but this recipe has to be made regularly.  It&#39;s just that good!

Be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe, though. The citric acid will eventually &#34;cook&#34; the chicken (in fact, this is how ceviche is made). As for freezing the chicken--yes, it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken. However, if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken, the culprit is most likely a dull knife. Of course, many of us freeze chicken, but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat. Given a choice, I would always choose &#34;never been frozen&#34; chicken, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t freeze it just to make cutting it easier."

I thought I was getting them thin, but not so. They were still yummy, just not traditional thin strips.  Also, may try in a cast iron skillet next time, just because!"

I felt they were a little bland so I revamped the seasoning to 2 tsp of cumin and 2 tsp of garlic powder and replaced the green onions with sliced red onions and 2 peppers  the color of the peppers depends on what I have on hand.Try yellow and orange peppers too. If you want to get rid of the after eating peppers burps try this: After slicing your peppers in strips soak in water for a few minutes and then drying your peppers with a paper towel. Then cooking. I can almost guarantee you won&#39;t be burping peppers all night.

I have been baking almost my entire life, usually using my mom&#39;s recipe.  After she passed away, I was unable to replicate it, but THIS is DARN close.  I only use granny smith apples, I use less sugar and brown sugar (slightly less than half a cup per pie), a bit more cinnamon, about the same nutmeg and flour. I skip the ginger, as I don&#39;t think the pie needs it. I don&#39;t care for a pie that is TOO sweet, so I am pretty liberal with the lemon juice.  (I might add a teaspoon more of flour, depending on how crazy I went with the lemon juice.)  I generally don&#39;t sugar the crust, but that is my preference.  I made two apple and two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year, and needless to say, there were NO leftovers.  To those that have a problem with the filling being too wet, I suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples.  The peel should be dark green.  If the texture of the apple is &#34;mealy&#34;, it is over ripe and will probably be too wet.  Thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom."

My top crust was made by using a maple leaf cookie cutter stamp and just covering the entire top of the pie with leaves. I just love how pretty it makes the pie! Just beautiful for Fall! This recipe is a keeper! Thank You!"

I&#39;ve done lots of different cakes, pies, and cupcakes, but I&#39;ve been a limited intimidated with the apple pie. Well, my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so, it was the right time to just go for it. I chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward. I did read through many of the reviews, which are very mixed--from best pie to worst pie. Honestly, that made me a little nervous, but I decided to remain positive and give it a shot. The result was spectacular!!! I had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy. He said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice. I took the next slice, and I was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how  well everything came out.  I will note that I followed the directions, without any changes. I used only Granny Smith apples and I didn&#39;t have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough. The pie&#39;s taste is amazing. I thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly. Honestly, the hardest part for me was making the crust, which I also decided to do for the first time. I was actually worried most about the double crust, but it somehow all worked out. Phew! I would definitely recommend this recipe. It&#39;s worth taking a chance."

I combined this recipe with a recipe from Martha Stewart and I used bits of both. I had heard about cornstarch being a great thickener instead of flour and I&#39;ve been experimenting with it lately. It&#39;s a great way to make sure it doesn&#39;t come out watery. I used extra sugar and just under 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I didn&#39;t even need to use the entire thing (spices (sea salt, ginger, nutmeg,  cinnamon, white sugar)and cornstarch mixture) . I noticed a lot of complaining in the comments about undercooked apples so I cooked everything together first and the cornstarch did its job to create a thick sauce right from the get-go. It just finished baking so I&#39;m at the cooling stage now. I added milk, cream and sugar to my egg wash and used it on the bottom crust to help keep it from being soggy as well as Heating a baking sheet for it to cook on. I&#39;ll edit if I remember!

Yes, I will admit the pie is a bit liquidy AT FIRST BUT after a half hour there was no more liquid pouring out.  Taste wise, it’s amazing you can taste everything perfectly. Maybe a little to much cinnamon, but thats preference.  baking wise, it did take a little bit longer than said but if you just keep your eye on it and put foil around places that are getting to brown it’ll come out beautifully.

So I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious. I will critique it though. Ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste. It definitely came out liquid-y however I found when you let it cool for about 45 mins the liquid becomes less runny. I used a Pillsbury pie crust. Phenomenal. I did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery. Didn’t really change anything. But the pie is truly delicious without adding or subtracting any ingredients.

Pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end, if they’re browning too quickly. Time given is not long enough to cook the filling. It needs twice as long as stated here. It also needs a higher starting temperature. It should be baked at 425 degrees for the first 20 minutes then turned down to 375 degrees to bake for a further 40 minutes or so. Also, I used Bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so I’d increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy."

The top layer of my crust was still raw after 25 mins, so I added 13 more minutes...it was then half- undercooked, so I added 10 more minutes and adjusted to 400 degrees.

I found the Taste of Home pie notes listed right after the recipe helpful, and also followed one of the the reviewer&#39;s recommendations to use heaping tablespoons full of flour.

About apples, if you live in an area that has fresh picked apples you are very lucky.  Apples after being stored lose moisture and this will cause your pie to be dry unless you add a little fluid or less flour.

I used my favorite go-to homemade pastry dough recipe for the crust. I used 4 granny smith apples and 2 honeycrisp apples .  That combination was perfect for us. Just the right amount of tart and sweet. TIP FOR ALL: If you dont want runny pies heres what to do; Mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice, let sit for at least 30 minutes, dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan, boil it gently for about 5-10 minutes to form a syrup (you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed) let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar, mix well then add your flour. This works every single time with every kind of pie. You will not have any more runny pie filling. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"

I used a combination of Jonagold and Granny Smith apples but increased the amount of apple to 9 cups.  This was just right for the stated amount of sugar, flour, and seasoning.  Juicy but not runny.  2). Baking time needs to be increased substantially.  I started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done.

I wish now that I&#39;d either tried another reviewer&#39;s tip of covering the whole top with tin foil (so I could have baked it longer), or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for 5  minutes to give them a head start.

First homemade apple pie and it came out the best I&#39;ve had in my life and that&#39;s not just because I made it haha. There were a few different changes I made and that is 1. I used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container. 2. I skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking. I know it&#39;s not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust. 3. I substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor.  Also I forgot to set the timer and didn&#39;t read the cover with foil part so I accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about 45 minutes. Apples weren&#39;t mushy but also not hard . Right in the middle. I used janigolds and  Mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard.

I would cut one of the sugars in half, also I did not listen others and increase the flour, but It may have helped the runnyness.

I read the other reviews several cooks said they added additional flour to thicken the mixture. I used granny smith apples so they don&#39;t produce a lot of juice so I didn&#39;t need the addition flour that is required in with more juicy apples. I did find the pie was a bit too sweet. My fault again I should have tasted my apples.

Tostitos Mild Chunky Salsa (used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great).  I used 2 cans black beans.  Used 1 C. lite sour cream which I added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer.  I used 1/2 C. Zesty Italian dressing (Kraft).  Used 8 flour tortillas instead of 6 &amp; put it all in a 9X13 baking pan.  I used 8 oz. authenic mexican cheese blend already pre-shredded &amp; more cilantro because we love it!

I used bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce. I don&#39;t think it would have tasted like pizza otherwise. The crust had to be baked longer than recommended and the zucchini needed more time in the colander to draw out the moisture. Knowing this now and making those changes I will be making it again.

Not only that, he&#39;s been requesting it at least once a week since I discovered it on your site a few months ago.  Getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge, but we started using a hand-held ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time.  It makes a huge difference, and I find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well.  I toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor, and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce (ground chicken, turkey, beef . . . even elk!) and it has come out fantastic every time.  It only gets better the longer you let it cook!"

I am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except for...then lists a long list of modifications. Well, I made some changes, too, and the outcome was great. I followed the process instructions as written. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef as I wanted a little zippier flavor, more pizza-like. I also added 1 tsp. of minced garlic after the sausage-onion mixture was browned (who doesn&#39;t like a little garlic in pizza?) My grocery store did not have Italian tomato sauce so I used regular and added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. Since the recipe called for either red or green pepper, I used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper, giving the dish a colorful look. My husband was a bit skeptical until the first bite--then he was a convert. He raved about it and I do have to say, it was delicious. I  had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bake-one-freeze-one. I&#39;ll have to see how that goes next time I make it because we&#39;ve plowed right into the next casserole the next night; leftovers were as delicious as the first night.

May take a couple times, but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper.  Also, my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we don&#39;t use beef or sausage - just spread pizza sauce over crust, put a think layer of pepperoni on this, then your cheeses and veggies.  Sometimes bacon with the pepperoni (WHY NOT?!?!)  After it&#39;s done everyone puts their own toppings on as desired.  They love to help make it, too, so are happy to eat it :)"

We are on a low-carb diet, my husband and I, and have a craving for Italian food, especially pizza.  This has solved our problem without busting the diet.  After the first time I made it, I have changed it a bit, not in the recipe, but in the preparation.  Since there are only 2 of us, I make the bottom &#34;crust&#34; in 2 8X8 inch pans, lined with parchment paper, partly up the side, and sprayed with cooking spray.  I make half of the recipe in each, and cook it as directed.  After cooling, I lift it out by the parchment, put both in a freezer container, and freeze until we are ready to use it.  When we need a pizza, we take one &#34;crust&#34;, thaw it in the 8X8 pan,  and put the toppings on, cook it in the oven as the recipe calls for.  It is almost as quick as a frozen pizza!"

The only changes I made were based on using ingredients on hand - used an Italian cheese blend for the mozzarella and a colby-jack blend for the cheddar because I had both of those.  I love a dish that is versatile in that way so just use whatever cheese combo you like best on this dish and you should have a winner.  Also, I took the advice of others and cooked the bell pepper with the beef and onions because my family prefers that combo.  My skeptical pizza loving daughter ate this and said it was good.

The sauce was anything but bland.  I will be making this recipe for a long time to come.  Thank you.

But his motto is &#34;I&#39;ll try anything once.&#34;  He absolutely raved about this dish.  After reading many of the reviews, I made sure that my zucchini was as dry as possible.  I didn&#39;t use salt, but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour.  Then squeezed it through paper towels.  I really wanted a firm crust so baked it for 25 minutes rather than 20.  That timing was absolutely perfect; the edges were just starting to brown.  I added garlic, red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce, and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking.  The ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than I had expected, and the zucchinie was less.  This is a great casserole in which to &#34;hide&#34; vegetables.  We&#39;d love to try it with Italian sausage instead of the ground beef, but unfortunately that would raise the fat content through the roof.  All and all, a yummy recipe."

That being said TOH altered my original submission of this recipe!  I don&#39;t do all those layers and use only 2 layers of noodles (6 total). I continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later! Isn&#39;t that what all cooks do as we learn?  One thing I will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results - like shred the mozzarella (preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and DOES affect the results). Also, don&#39;t use cheap ingredients (garbage in garbage out). If you use pre-processed ingredients don&#39;t blame the recipe!!   I recently found a true Italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made!  In regards to the sauce-I have learned that weather (like humidity) actually makes a difference. I purposely make a thick sauce so the layers &#34;stay in place&#34; as I dislike runny lasagne. Again, personal preference!  Thank you all for your comments and enjoy!!!"

So this is American Lasagna and it&#39;s delicious - it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be.  Lasagna comes from the Greeks - I actually make a Greek lasagna better known as Pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef  but when I want American Lasagna I make this recipe.   Did you know the Brits actually found a recipe for Lasagna from the 1390&#39;s?  Each country has perfected their own claim to Lasagna fame.  When the Italians make it in Northern Italy they do not use ricotta cheese, they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella.  Ricotta is used in the Southern region only, this is why many Italians in America use ricotta - most are descendants from Southern Italians.  So even Mario or Giada is making it wrong if you are from Tuscany."

Assembled everything a day ahead and cooked it 50 minutes and refrigerated it (covered tightly). The next day, I warmed it 20 minutes at 250 and 10 minutes at 350 until the edges bubbled a bit. It was a huge hit. Next time I will use real mozzarella cheese and shred it myself, but this time I didn&#39;t have the energy for that.

Last night I served it to my dinner guests, and even the person who said he HATED lasagna ate a great big helping. This really does make a lot, so I suggest that you use a nice deep lasagna pan. I made some simple additions to suit our tastes: a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat, a 10 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms (drained), and I increased the sausage to one pound. I also increased the tomato sauce to 30 ounces. Extra mozzarella on every layer. Perfecto! Helpful hints: Add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesn&#39;t stick to the foil. And in response to several questions about the sausage, recommendations are to use ground Italian sausage, NOT pork breakfast sausage or sausage links. I made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time I made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it. Yikes"

Instead of mozzarella and provolone I use a 5 or 6 cheese Italian blend. I also use sharp, Jack and Colby. I use 15 ounces of ricotta and two eggs instead of three. Today I added a little chicken broth to loosen it up a bit. It wasn&#39;t soupy!!!! The seasonings I changed up a bit too, in addition to Italian I used a complete sazon seasoning, and adobo. CLassico traditional sause and diced tomatoes with oregano and Basil.  I Sauteed garlic and shallots.  I love love love the cottage cheese, it gives the ricotta a little kick.

However, I am confused. I went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients. If you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone; then when you get to step 3 you are supposed to layer with provolone. Provolone is similar to mozzarella, but the instructions call for provolone AND mozzarella. Note the recipe also calls for 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese. No where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned. Finally, the sauce is to be simmered for one hour. Unless you want it burned, don&#39;t plan on that. It is very thick and I had to stop with nine minutes to go. Obviously this recipe was not kitchen-tested."

I only use one can of tomato paste I feel that when you use two it has too much of a metallic taste (especially when eating leftovers) and it also makes the sauce too thick and reheated leftovers are too dry.  I also use slightly more tomato sauce and use two 15 oz cans of sauce.  I am not a huge sausage fan so I usually omit the sausage and just use the 1 lb of beef.

I couldn’t decide whether to use vegetable vs chicken bouillon so did 1tsp of each. The tsp of hot sauce is NOT optional in my opinion, it’s a must. And no, it doesn’t make it spicy at all. I also added maybe an 1/8-1/4 tsp dry mustard (to give it that background kick like in beer cheese soup), 1/4 cup diced onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic into the veggies. I used sharp cheddar for the most flavor &amp; it came out perfect. Normally I’m always adding extra salt or bouillon to most soups but didn’t need to with this one.

So I  made some slight modifications second time around which prospective cooks may want to consider.  I added a lot more carrots and celery, around 1 cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves. I found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time I made it so next time I added the celery to the soup base 3 minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower. I also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce. i do like some kick to my soups so I added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time.  I used red pepper flakes second time as I thought the Tabasco Sauce turned the soup a bit too orange. I like the suggestion to add some chopped onions as well.

I measured my ingredients using 5 3/4 cups cauliflower (including some sliced stem pieces), 3/4 cup carrot, 1/2 cup celery (1 stalk), and 2 chicken cubes. Watch the cooking time for veggies to avoid mushy texture. I cooked mine 10-minutes and thought cauliflower was a bit too soft. Have cheese sauce ingredients measured and ready once the pot of vegges are truned on, this goes together quickly. I l enjoyed this soup because the recipe only used one cup of cheese, the calories were lower, and it avoided a thick, glue-like soup. Serves 4 as a main dish; they will want more!"

This website is less clickbait than the other top of google bread recipes. 

The bread comes out good, if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center. My girlfriend says it’s too salty so I’m trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt. I thought the salt was fine but I want her to eat the bread too so, less salt. And I tried it with honey instead of sugar, but it didn’t look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar. The yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but wasn’t bubbling, so I put sugar in there with the honey too. I will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time. 

This recipe is a good baseline to go off of and you’ll probably want to make adjustments to your taste."

Dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan, but not over, otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan.   Carrie, sugar is the simplest of the &#39;starches&#39; that yeast needs to form, you can use honey or even corn starch,  sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest.  if you use honey or starch it will take longer.  if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour, that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour.  Remember not to put yeast into too hot of liquid mix or it make kill it."

Easy even if you are so so at following directions. I left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo. Not too many bubbles for me on the yeast either, but again, turned out like the photo. I baked 35 minutes. The hollow sound didn&#39;t sound hollow to me, it sounded dense to me but then again I don&#39;t know what to listen for as an amateur. Either way, it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part. This really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture, talk about diluting the mixture with garbage! The store bread you pay $2 or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality. It is worth way less than that and I made this quality bread for about 1.66  per batch . 83 cents per loaf at 33 cents for yeast, 2.50 for 5 lb bag flour, divided., at 3 1/3 cups per pound, using 6 1/4 cups. You could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isn&#39;t necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make A LOT of bread before the yeast expires. I&#39;d experiment by putting Everything Seasoning on the top of it, Caraway seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seed pits, the list goes on. The bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty, not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap! Good luck! Youtube: LCatRN"

Thank you to Steve for the suggestion regarding flour, started out with 6 cups and added as needed/kneaded ended up with the whole 6 3/4 cups.  The only thing I did different was I used a couple of tips I had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work.  The first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave, starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110-115 deg f., then add yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar.  While mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f. then turn off and allow to cool slightly, then put the dough in there to raise (door closed). I use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans I covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking.  I haven&#39;t had an issue with dough rising since I started using this method, as long as yeast is before &#34;best by&#34; date."

Making bread is not an exact science.  The amount of flour you use isn&#39;t going to exactly match what is in this recipe.  (or any recipe)  The amount varies depending on temperature and humidity.  If it&#39;s cool and/or dry in your house, you will use less flour.  You will have to adjust by feel and texture as you knead the dough.  Don&#39;t add all the flour at once.   It also helps to have a small pan with some water on the rack below the bread pan.  This adds additional humidity while you bake the bread. (Giving a nicer crust)"

My wife and family also love this delicious sandwich bread. Definitely doesn&#39;t require all of the flour. I used around 5 cups. Everything else is spot on though.

The second time I used baking flour, and the bread was perfect. Crisp yet chewy. Thank you."

Reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be 1 cup of water to 2 cups of flour per loaf of bread.  Oil can be higher ratio.   The bread when it rises will create its own heat.  SO if you have dry flower that is why... change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs.

As an experienced baker, I can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic. To answer some other concerns, it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes. This fully activated the yeast and can improve results. To the person whose bread came out doughy, have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate? Often, home ranges can vary in actual temperature."

I bake a lot of fancy breads and thought I would give this a go and it came out fine. I also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves.

It was a little heavier than store bought, mass produced, &#39;half-baked&#39; store bought garbage, but that is obviously to be expected. We went through both in less than 2 days. I&#39;d make it again.   For those having issues, following directions is key. Use bread flour. Be patient. Put away your bread machine. Temp your water. Let the starter work. Don&#39;t use too much flour....only what it needs. (You probably won&#39;t need all 6 cups) If this isn&#39;t taking you a good 3-4 hours to make, you&#39;re doing it wrong."

The texture of the bread was sorta like cornbread and a little mushy but not to bad really not great or terrible. it was very crumbly and hard to cut thin slices.

I&#39;ve used rapid rise yeast that&#39;s close to 8 months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly.  However, if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line, that could kill it long before the expiration date.  Dissolving it in water that&#39;s too hot will do it in too.  Best to have the water 105? to 110?.  If you set it  out to rise is in a cold room, that will prevent any rising.  I warm the oven a bit before I start and turn it off after a minute or so when it&#39;s around 100?.  That seems to work well for rising.  If the dough doesn&#39;t rise even after it&#39;s set in the oven to bake, then the yeast was dead."

However, I feel like it has some important steps left out that you need to know if you&#39;re not an experienced bread Baker. First of all - to activate your yeast - you need to put the warm water and yeast and sugar alone in your bowl. Stir it well, cover it, and set it aside when it&#39;s frothy looking - those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go. THEN add all the other ingredients. Otherwise it&#39;s a great basic recipe. Make sure to work the dough long enough - I do half with a dough hook and my KitchenAid and half by hand on a flour dusted counter. It needs to feel really smooth and stretchy. Good luck! It tastes delicious and a perfect texture!"

I also divide the dough into thirds (and can even go for four small loaves), and it does keep for a few days, IF it lasts that long! :-D The final bread product, when made with bread flour, is a good crumb, nice chew and wonderfully crispy, yet soft, crust.A WONDERFUL beginner&#39;s recipe!

I&#39;ve made this recipe more than once -- several times at high elevation in Denver, another time at/near sea level in Houston.  I never leave reviews for recipes, but felt the need to pay it forward on this one.  PRO TIP (based on experience and experimentation): use UNBLEACHED bread flour if you want a softer crust.  I&#39;ve used standard, all-purpose bleached flour, but the crust ends up too hard.  It&#39;s almost too difficult to cut through it in the end.  I much prefer the softer crust.  As for the rest of the recipe, follow it.  It&#39;s perfect.  I mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and, literally, a regular fork.  Yes, my arm begins to ache by the time I&#39;ve added the 4th cup of flour.  Also, if you are a bread-baking newbie like I was, I used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the 1st and 2nd rise. "

I also added cheese and jarred jalape?os and was worried that it would mess up with not changing any of the other measurements -turned out delicious! turned out delicious   Thank you for this recipe !

I only needed 5.5 cups of flour and it still came out quite dense.  I baked in the oven one level up from the bottom with a cookie sheet on the bottom level.  This keeps the bottom from getting too burnt.It came out looking exactly like the picture.  My kids love it too!  This is great cause I hate breadmakers since the belt eventually slips on them and they make more noise.  Now I can make bread with no preservatives!

I had to start dividing the dough into three portions and put the loaves into smaller pans since my family nearly inhales it every time I make it. I don&#39;t even need to adjust the baking time, they turn out beautifully every time. As for the amount of flour, I think the recipe is only showing you what you will need before you start, like say you only need 5 cups of flour for the bread, what happens if you only have that much flour? You can&#39;t knead the bread so well cuz you ran out, I tested how much I end up using after my dough is ready to be kneaded, and I use almost another whole cup of flour."

I finally found this recipe,  and while reluctant, because of the last 2 failures,  I decided to give this one a try. I am sooooo glad I did! Not only are the ingredients simple, but so is putting it together and making it.I did make a few minor modifications based on some of the reviews. I used 5 1/4 cups of flour instead of the 6 1/4 to 6 3/4 cups it calls for. I found that the recommended amount of flour was just entirely too much. I also used vegetable oil instead of canola, because that&#39;s all I had.This bread is wonderful! My husband, son and mother ate a whole loaf in  two hours! The other loaf is almost gone today.It is so moist and soft. I can&#39;t believe it turned out this good! I made everyone french toast this morning and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. We will no longer spend $3 for a loaf of store bought bread. I&#39;ve finally found my tried and trusted recipe right here!Good luck everyone! Enjoy this awesome recipe. Your family will thank you for it! :)P.S. This site should allow us to post pictures, to prove how our recipes turned out."

My husband and I have stopped buying bread and only eat what I make :)Linda that posted Nov 15, 2016...The olive oil will make it salty and taste a little weird.  I would recommend using either canola or vegetable oil (corn oil may also work, but haven&#39;t tried it).  As long as you use the right type of oil one tablespoon of salt is perfect.  I also like to grease the bowl and pans with Un salted butter. It adds a nice slight butter taste."

I wonder if the 1 tablespoon of salt is correct - I don&#39;t think I have ever added 1 tablespoon of salt to anything I have made.   I thought this bread tasted too salty.  I didn&#39;t have canola oil so I used olive oil and  sprayed the pans with Pam - not sure if those things had anything to do with the salty taste.  I will not be making this again.

I also needed 6 full cups of flour.  I made one loaf of bread and rolled the other half out into twelve cinnamon rolls.  My dough raised beautifully.  I have a proofing setting on my oven, and let the loaf rise for 40 minutes, which is about how much it took me to make the cinnamon rolls. Cinnamon rolls took about an hour to rise.  Turned out great - very easy dough to work with, and this bread will go into my recipe rotation."

(1) the first time I made it, I used all purpose flour, as the recipe called for.  The bread came out really good.  (2) the second time I made it, I used bread flour.  The bread came out really good.  In both, the texture was good, but just  a bit different from each other.  Then came (3) and this time, I used a combination of 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 bread flour.  Results?  Perfect phenomenal bread.  This had a great texture and taste and this will be the way I make it from now on.Ok, now, I like a few others, have found that 5 cups of flour proves to be enough flour.When I made bread tonight, I made 2 small loaves and a pan of cinnamon rolls.

It does take some time, but most of that is from rising and baking and I can still do other tasks while that&#39;s happening, so I think it&#39;s worth it.

I have adjusted this recipe by adding 1 Tbsp. ground Navel orange and I also added 1/2 tsp. each of all-spice andnutmeg to the other spices and dry ingredients listed in this recipe!  I used 1 cup shredded zucchini with 1/2 cup unpeeled chopped tart apple, rather than 1-1/2 cups zucchini. For the icing, I&#39;d used 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar-the 2 cups didn&#39;t make for a good spreading consistency!  I&#39;d also just melted the butter with the brown sugar-I didn&#39;t cube the butter.I used evaporated milk and started with 1/4 cup milk, and gradually added UP TO 2 Tbsp.more milk to achieve a desirable spreading consistency!  I did have to stir the frosting with a mixing spoon to make the icing pliable and easier for me to spread.

Also, I would suggest adding chopped nuts to the batter--walnuts or pecans--maybe a 1/2 cup, depending on your preference.Also, for the frosting, I think you would run into problems adding the melted butter, brown sugar and milk with the confectioners sugar (as a preference, I would subsitute skim milk for the 2%).  I would do the icing a bit differently.  Warm the milk and brown sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolves.  Soften butter slightly in the microwave, then place in a stand mixer and mix until smooth.  Add confectioners sugar and mix.  Add cooled brown sugar/milk mixture to the above and mix until the frosting is combined.   Add additional confectioners sugar to achieve a spreadable consistency for frosting."

Like a spice cake as one review said. They weren&#39;t as moist as I had imagined from the reviews. I think I will make them bigger next time. I don&#39;t believe I made them big enough for the moistness. The carmel frosting is DEFINITELY worth the time and effort it takes to make it. I know I will use it on cakes and other things.

This has become my husband&#39;s favorite cool-weather soup.  I&#39;ve found that we always have leftovers with just the two of us and the tortellini tastes great in this soup, but it absorbs a large amount of the broth after the first day and kind of &#34;takes over&#34;.

No hidden steps in between the other steps to prepare food for cooking. Used pre-chopped container of onion, and pre-minced garlic to make this even faster with no chopping. Made exactly per recipe (using sweet italian sausage) -- no swapping out water for more chicken broth, and it was perfect. If I had made that swap, as some readers did, it would have been too potent for our taste. Recipe perfect as is."

Easy skill level and quick.  Per other reviews, I used all chicken broth in place of water and added (1) 15 oz can great northern beans.

It is perfect as is but next time I am going to add a parmesan rind for extra rustic taste."

We use Wegman&#39;s chicken sausage in various flavors (usually mild italian and sundried tomato and basil), and if I don&#39;t have fresh garlic, garlic powder works fine. I also use frozen cut leaf spinach instead of fresh. It always turns out great, even when I double the recipe!"

It was delicious - very flavorful - and hearty. I used a total of two 32 oz Swanson chicken broth boxes because I thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing... I was glad I did. I did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth, which my bigger boxes of broth took care of. I skipped the can of diced tomatoes because I&#39;m not a fan but I can see how they would add to the soup for others. The recipe calls for turkey sausage but I used regular Italian sausage and it calls for 12 oz but I had 16 oz so I used the whole thing. For the  refrigerated tortellini, I used the tiny cheese raviolettis that Buitoni offers. I used fresh spinach from one of the 9 oz &#34;salad&#34; bags (probably used about 7 oz of it and didn&#39;t chop it up) and I did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because I love it. I used more than a dash of red pepper... did a couple of shakes. We did put shredded parmesan on top and I highly recommend. I served the soup with really good five grain bread and butter and, as I write this, I wish I was having the meal again tonight because it was AMAZING."

I sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting. I added the dried basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes when I added the broth and tomatoes (I did not add any water) so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out. (I used more seasoning than recipe called for and used 2 heaping tsps of dried basil, 1 tsp of black pepper, and added 3/4 tsp red pepper to suit our need for heat)I also added 3 tbs of chicken bouillon and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant.

This turned out great! I did a few swap outs, because teenager 🙄😑 I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I 100% recommend putting soup over your rice, or grain of choice. I have made a few different versions over the years and found out (I’d say kind of the hard way) the first time I made it to separate the grain and soup! You really can’t store or re-heat it well with it added in during cooking. I got gloop instead of soup the next day!"

I am happy to finally be adding mine.  I can’t add much more then what has already been spoken for. It’s a greet good, satisfying soup. One that really matures overnight.It has the perfect name, it does taste like a stuffed pepper!  Due to some diet restrictions I made the following changes. No brown sugar or tomato sauce. I used 1 very large fresh tomato.  I used  a packet of beefy onion soup mix and added some Better Than Boullion Beef base to the mix. I upped the amount of green pepper and used less ground beef. And I used no rice.This is all about the beefy taste wrapped around Green Peppers.It was most enjoyable.TOH-VFE"

I did NOT (wish I had) know there was such a thing as GREEN PEPPER SOUP until I was at an upscale restaurant a few months ago and it was one of my choices for soup.  I tried it and was blown away how good it was... it reminded me of my mom&#39;s!  That night when I got home....I searched online to find this v recipe. I had all the ingredients.... so the next day I made it and now it is a monthly dinner plus enough for MY lunch the next day! I did add a few splashes of .... worcestershire because that was something I remember my mom putting in her stuffed peppers &amp; with my eyes closed it was liked eating my mom&#39;s stuffed peppers! Amazing!!! To put a slice of American cheese on top of each bowl..... will blow your mind.... makes it creamy and delicious!  I am a picky eater.... so to find this recipe is the BEST!  To make it thicker add a little more cooked rice other than that ENJOY!

I made only 1/2 of the recipe to make sure that it would be one that I truly like.  Like others, I added the white rice to each bowl first, then topped it with the soup and mixed it in.  I wanted to avoid the common complaint that the rice expanded and got gummy as it sat in the refrigerator.  The only change I would make is add more green pepper and reduce the amount of fluid.  I cooked this on the stove for a couple of hours, adding fluid as needed.  I used beef broth and a bit of water, and only 1 beef bouillon cube."

Everything else was the same as the recipe written here. I say that because the recipe published in the magazine in 1996 did not call for any water at all. Why does the website recipe say to add 2quarts of water? Did the restaurant notify the magazine after it came out that they had forgotten to include it in their recipe when they sent it in?

I was worried about the brown sugar since I don&#39;t like meat to have any sweetness to it so I gradually added white sugar and decided 1 T. was enough. I also added a t. of garlic powder.

I did read through the reviews before making and decided to make some adjustments of my own. I started off by cooking the green peppers with 1lb of ground beef (not 2), which I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, and a little seasoning and kosher salt. I also used beef stock instead of water and cut it back to about 46.5oz (1 32oz box container and one 14.5oz can) instead of 2 quarts. My family and I like a thicker consistency with our soups so I added a little at a time, making sure it was just right. I also used 3c of (cooked) instant brown rice (that&#39;s what I had in the pantry) since another review recommended it! This soup turned out way better than expected and my SO says it&#39;s definitely a keeper! I also liked the idea of serving it with bread so I added Hawaiian Sweet Rolls to our meal! Yummy!"

We topped it with shredded extra sharp cheddar and had crusty French bread on the side.  It was extremely filling and fairly healthy.

It has never failed!  It is ALWAYS so moist. It does not have a “coffee” taste, in case someone is curious; it is not “overly” chocolate, but just right.  I’ve doubled it before when making my kids multi-layered, multi-shaped birthday cakes. Everyone always complements it!! I have made the frosting listed in the recipe, but have made other “favorite” frostings instead, too, mostly because I don’t use shortening. I use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly. Someone said the center comes out raw....the recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is. However, it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time. I typically average a few extra minutes and it’s perfect!!! It also does freeze great, without frosting. When I’m making shaped birthday cakes, I freeze my cut-off extra pieces as I’m layering and then take them out for a later day. Sometimes, I frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving, but not always. They’re great without it too."

It&#39;s called &#34;Never Fail Cake&#34; in my household.  The coffee deepens the flavor and the texture is fluffy &amp; moist, but it is not a coffee flavored cake.  Sometimes I ice it with a peanut butter frosting and then stand back and watch people lick  &amp; scrape their plates.  Yeah, it&#39;s that good.  If I have to see one more 1 star rating from a &#34;reviewer&#34; that has not attempted the recipe...well, I&#39;ll just have another piece of cake and laugh. This isn&#39;t Pinterest or someone&#39;s blog, it lowers the rating unnecessarily."

For the frosting, it&#39;s granulated sugar, and you must follow the instructions and beat 10 minutes, using a whisk attachment if you have one. For me, it would be better using 1 cup of butter rather than half butter and half shortening, as I don&#39;t enjoy the shortening taste, but it was definitely a nicer consistency than my Mom&#39;s traditional buttercream and I&#39;ll be making this again using all butter."

You cook the flour and milk stirring constantly so there is no lumps and bring it to a boil.  Then take it off the stove to cool down put in fridge until cold.

I have never had very good luck making meatloaf.  It was either way too dense or it would fall apart.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I did, however, add/change a couple of things.
A while back I ordered &#34;tomato powder&#34; from the Spice House.  I always forget that I have it.  But I saw it in the refrigerator (keeps it from getting hard as a rock), and figured I&#39;d add it in to the ground beef.  I used about a tablespoon.  I suppose you could always use a couple of tablespoons of the double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube.

I also used mostly 90/10 ground beef, but figured I&#39;d add some 80/20 in for some extra moisture (and obviously more fat).   My mom always used Ritz crackers for meatloaf or meatballs....so I combined Ritz crackers and saltines...not really sure it made a difference.  Then I added about one or two teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet to the mixture.

I&#39;m not sure if my changes made any difference at all from the original recipe, but this was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  My 29 year old son, asked me if it was any good, and I told him to taste it and let me know.  He called from the kitchen and said,   &#34;Dad, this is the BEST meatloaf!  What the world did you put in this?&#34;"

I make a couple of changes, though. I use 2 pounds of ground beef (or meatloaf mix; that&#39;s good, too). Otherwise, it turns out too &#34;loose&#34; for our taste. I grate the onion instead of chopping it. That way, its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf. And finally, instead of one free-form loaf in the middle of my 13&#34; x 9&#34; pyrex pan, I make two. That way, there&#39;s more surface to be covered with the sauce, and we just like it better that way. Leftovers make awesome sandwiches, too!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Michelle Beran!"

Next time though I&#39;ll follow the advice of a previous review and add the Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and skip the sauce.  My family only likes a little sauce on top and this recipe made way more than we needed.  Instead I&#39;ll just add a little ketchup to the top before cooking.  I used 2.25 pounds of ground beef instead of 1.5 pounds because that&#39;s how it was packaged and I didn&#39;t have a need to save a small amount.  It still turned out fantastic.  Much better than using the meatloaf seasoning packet like I&#39;ve always done before.

He explained that it&#39;s called a Pig Pickin&#39; Cake because it was the traditional dish brought to a pig picking in his neck of North Carolina- a pig picking being a &#34;neighborhood&#34; event that follows a pig roasting: After the pig is roasted, the women get together to pick and shred the meat from the carcass, for the making of traditional Carolina BBQ. Our family&#39;s version includes a golden butter cake mix (box), 1/2c oil, the fruit from acan of mandarins and 4T of the juice, and 3 whole eggs. The frosting is 20can of crushed pineapple- not drained- with 1 box instant vanilla pudding mixed in. After about 5 mins, fold the whipped topping (12oz)  into the pudding/pineapple. I have made this as a sheet cake, 2 layer cake, cupcakes, or in a springform cut into 3 layers. Always delicious, and one of my very favorite desserts! Thanks Uncle Wally, miss you!"

First of all let me say that the cake baked up fabulously.  In fact I followed the cake recipe only changing to a gluten free cake mix.  I did make the frosting with a 12 oz. size whipped cream.  I had some left over and and figured why not.  This cake was so moist and delicious.  Even better the second day.  If you need to eat gluten free go ahead and make this cake.

It also called for a 20-oz can of crushed pineapple, drained.  The pineapple juice was used as liquid in the cake mix.

If you like plain food, then you&#39;d like this. But if I were to make it again, I would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure. The casserole doesn&#39;t really have any sauce to it, and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole, leaving you with 2 layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato.

I add a little granulated garlic, and I also use fresh mushrooms and saute them over med-high heat until they get a little color.  Ground turkey works great, too.  Love love love this recipe."

Just like chili, barbecue sauce and pizza vary from state to state, region to region, so does cornbread. There&#39;s no right or wrong way to make it. It&#39;s what you grew up with, what your grandma made and what you came to love. Nowhere does this recipe claim to be &#34;southern&#34; cornbread. Or &#34;northern&#34; cornbread. Make your cornbread however you like, just don&#39;t tell me my way is wrong."

I do wonder if people saying cornbread from the south is dry is because of #1) in the north they rarely use real good ole-bacon grease. and REAL buttermilk. so this is1. #2) most southerners that I grew up with counted on eating a slice from a cast-iron skillet( the best way to stay moist and have a crispy crust.)

When doing a double batch i do  2 cups all purpose 2 cups whole wheat flour and then I split the remaining 2/3 cups between chia seeds and flax meal.

I made this cake for the 4th of July (what&#39;s more American than chocolate cake, right?!) and it was a grand slam, home run with everyone!  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I added a generous dash of cinnamon to the batter with the other dry ingredients.  The cake came out exactly like it looks in the picture on the website.  It is so delicious, I can&#39;t stop eating it!  It&#39;s dense (I love dense cakes as opposed to light and airy, spongy cakes), super moist and full of chocolate flavor.  The frosting pairs perfectly with the cake.   The recipe made three full size, 9 inch layers, I just wrapped one layer in plastic wrap and foil and put it in the freezer for another day.  The frosting was more than enough to generously frost two layers, and then have about a cup leftover.  At first I was stumped because I never heard of &#34;leftover frosting&#34; before, not in my house!  This frosting recipe left enough leftover for us spoon-loving-frosting-eating adults, and more for another time!  I bet I could even frost 1/2 dozen cupcakes with the leftover frosting.  So to sum it up, if you love rich, chocolately, moist, dense cake with tangy, sweet, chocolately frosting of which you will have some leftover, then make this cake!  Thank you for sharing, Sandy!

I’ve made it twice now and the reviews were outstanding. Very moist and dense. Be prepared and have some cake lovers ready to help eat it! Could halve the recipe and have enough for a smaller crowd. I read one review that said it wasn’t chocolatey enough or “lacked chocolate flavor”. So not true.... you can control the depth of chocolate flavor by the quality of the cocoa powder you use. Deep rich chocolate flavor with Scharffen Berger cocoa powder. This will forever be my chocolate cake recipe!!

It was delicious from the cake to the frosting. One problem I did have was it was a little dry and not as moist like I like my cakes. I don&#39;t know if I left them in the oven too long or what. I will try it again maybe with a little less flour the next time to see if that helps. Any advice would be appreciated.

I used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water, and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  After adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin. I&#39;ve never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it.  I baked 2 layers on the top rack and 1 on the bottom rack.  The top rack cakes were ready at the 30 minute mark so I pulled them out.The cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle, so I moved it to the top rack and baked it another 7 or 8 minutes.  The top of that 3rd layer had a funny darkened pupil-in-an-eyeball sort of center appearance, probably from the jiggling it received when I moved it to the top rack, but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted.  I made my own frosting (a butter &amp; cocoa powder version) that I know is delicious, since some folks mentioned they didn&#39;t like the sour cream flavored icing much.  The cake had a nice dense, moist texture and a great not-too-chocolatey flavor.  It makes a huge cake; mine was 4&#34; tall when assembled, so be sure to cut thin slices!  I will save this to bake again- we shared a huge chunk with the neighbors and are still enjoying leftovers!"

A quick tip to make sure that the cake has a good bake (or to make any cake bake well) is to have room-temperature liquids/soft solids. I allow the butter, eggs, and sour cream to get to room temperature before using them. I always keep my vanilla extract at room temperature. I also used cake flour and follow the tips on the cake flour box about how to compensate for all-purpose flour (it does make a difference for cakes, I promise.) While the batter does get more liquidy after adding the water, I wonder if Esteli had the oven pre-heated to the right temperature?If you don&#39;t prefer the frosting there are THOUSANDS of frosting recipes out there. Pick one that is highly rated by many people and try it. :)"

Just a note to other baker&#39;s, after cooling and resting this cake seemed to compress a tad more than most other cakes (I used shaped pans, bit had to do carving to get it right. It was very worth it. The rocket cake had a tapered base and wide middle but the cake still stood firmly on its own. And the two baker&#39;s who tried the cake asked for the recipe. Thank you!"

I live at high altitude and had to make adjustments to account for that.  I decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, increased the flour to 3 cups, increased the water by adding an additional 1/3 cup  and decreased baking soda to 2 1/2 tsp.  I made cupcakes instead of cake. I usually let my batter rest for at least 15 minutes before baking. However, I made my first batch as soon as the batter was loaded and the cupcakes rose okay but spread a little.  The batter that had a chance to rest made perfect cupcakes. They rose without spreading at all.  It&#39;s important at high altitude to not fill the pans too high.  I filled them to about a half to  3/4 inch from the top and it was perfect.  Unfortunately there are no magic adjustments that you can use for every recipe. It&#39;s all trial and error at altitude, but my adjustments luckily were perfect for this recipe."

Very thick three layers and super moist. I was not thrilled with the frosting. It has a sharp taste to it possibly from the sour cream. It ended up tasting primarily like powdered sugar/sour  instead of being chocolatey like I was hoping. Nonetheless I received many compliments and as some other commenters have said it does keep well for several days.

This is THE perfect chocolate cake and my new go-to recipe for birthday and other special occasions. I&#39;ve never had good luck with layer cakes but this one worked perfectly. First time I forgot to add water (love the idea of using coffee instead of water) but it still turned out fine. Second time the batter at the bottom of the bowl did not get mixed well and it STILL turned out okay. Each time I spread raspberry preserves between layers and on top prior to frosting. Love the silky smooth frosting. Then I made genache and poured it over the top--so rich and yummy. Can&#39;t wait to make another one!!!

It&#39;s my new go-to chocolate cake recipe when I don&#39;t want to make a flourless cake and I don&#39;t want to make one with a brownie/decadence density.  One thing I do is add espresso powder, though.  It&#39;s almost a knee-jerk reaction for me to find some way to add more flavor to a baked item that requires water than simply adding water. Substituting the water with hot coffee or just adding a teaspoon or so of espresso powder to the boiling water is a great way to accent the chocolate flavor. Wonderful recipe!"

So yummy! It was so fancy when sliced and displayed and all my close friends were demanding slices as soon as they saw it. My dessert was the first to go and EVERYONE declared it to be one of the best chocolate cakes they had ever had. The balance of the sour cream with the sugar kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet and it was more old school in recipe without the white sugar and with the boiling water and sour cream. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet bakers chocolate. The frosting is plentiful and delicious. And for a garnish, I crushed up some chocolate chips and dusted the top. It was a massive hit. Everyone declared it to be so moist and to taste like it came from a bakery. Definitely an awesome cake. Will be making it again for Thanksgiving."

I did add a few things which is very much what I always seem to do. First, I didn&#39;t have the chicken breast, so I used the chicken thighs. I didn&#39;t skin or debone them, I used them as they were, just made sure I cooked them long enough. Second, I also added some seasonings to the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, &amp; Italian seasoning along with S&amp;P. Third, to the broth I added the juice of one lemon.

Following ideas from other reviewers, I sliced my large chicken breasts (2) in half. That worked well.  I also added 1/4 C white wine to the sauce, and the little remaining flour left after dredging the breasts to thicken it a little. I was heavy on the mushrooms, cause we love them.  I added some snipped fresh rosemary and chives to the sauce because we love fresh herbs.  I served over zucchini noodles and asparagus that were sautéed in olive oil, garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  It was delightful.

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly other than upgrading by using portobello mushrooms. Procedure-wise: I sliced two 8-oz. chicken breasts lengthwise rather than pound them to 1/4&#34; thickness. Doing that saved a little effort and it did not at all impact the taste. This recipe can make a novice cook look like a seasoned pro. It was flavorful, juicy and the two of us could have easily eaten the other two servings. :)  I will definitely be making this again.  I liked the idea shared in the reviews of sauteing the onions. I&#39;m also toying with the idea of using half chicken broth and half white wine for the sauce mixture.  To answer &#34;Lousey Cook in Texas&#39; question: I don&#39;t know that it would taste as good as making it fresh. The breading on the chicken might get a bit soggy. You could try it but it really doesn&#39;t take long to put this all together."

The recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake. Only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar. After that, use a spatula to mix everything else in, because if you continue to use a mixer you&#39;ll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture, which will make it less fluffy. Also add the milk and butter before the flour, because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture. If you prefer something less sweet, use 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 2. You could also melt the butter first, before stirring in the milk, just to make it melt faster."

Nice basic ingredients that I already had, and a simple recipe. Wanted to start a little tradition with my young daughters that they could pass on —making a simple cake from scratch.  While it was a little sweet for my own taste, they absolutely loved it. The texture was spongy and moist, and the plain cake was a hit solo. I also made a berry compote to add a bit of tartness for my own preference (and my mom’s) and the girls loved that too. I guess the key is in proper mixing.    Not a fake review! There were a couple negative reviews from so-called “baking professionals” that said the cake turned out awful or that the positive reviews were not genuine. Real mom here."

I added a T of vanilla bean paste plus the t of vanilla. I used half and half instead of 2%. I beat the eggs a long time until they were light and fluffy and then added the sugar and beat again until light and fluffy for quite a bit. My batter was smooth and creamy. I baked this in a glass baking dish so I reduced my oven temp to 335. When it was done and cooled I made a fresh blueberry compote to serve on top with a dollop of homemade whipped cream but refrigerated whipped topping would work just as well. I liked it because it’s a light dessert without heavy frosting to hold it down. Perfect for a light spring or summer supper.

I was reading the reviews and I just wanted to take the time to say please do not follow the advice given by Jacksjojo. I wish there was a way to report it. You cannot can anything with eggs, milk, or flour. Even if you could these directions are not an appropriate way of canning. Just because the lid seals does not mean that is safe. You could potentially die of botulism or worse kill someone else when you give it as a gift."

Use 6 to 7  PINT size  wide mouth jars, Grease inside, fill about 2/3 full place on a pan to bake @ 350  about 18 mins.  or until touch test works. Place lids and rings on as soon as you can after removing from the oven, they will seal ... tighten after jars have cooled ... if sealed they will be GOOD for at 2-3 months in cabinet.

You could really use this cake as a base and add any type of extract or flavoring you&#39;re in the mood for.   I also agree with the others who said it&#39;s very important to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes, maybe even a little longer.  I also made sure I beat the sugar and eggs until they were nice and airy too.  35 minutes in the oven was perfect.

For taste I would give it 4.  I am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes I made below.If someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe, but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize and/or correct the following:Salt:  Salt is necessary UNLESS you are using salted butter.  Most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe.  This recipe may have been written for use with salted butter, but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted, it will come out bland without the addition of salt. I added 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect.Batter: My batter was unusually runny, I would even call it watery. I have made cakes with very runny batter previously, but I was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didn&#39;t mention the consistency of the batter. I added 1/2 cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise. Your results may vary, however."

He used full-fat Miracle Whip and packaged pre-cooked rigatoni that he chopped up which was a little chewier than homemade. He cut the onion to one and used a mild onion. The chopping is a chore to say the least but he likes doing putzy stuff like that. Using sliced water chestnuts would trim some of the time off. Since he made it the night before, the dressing and onions had time to mellow.Exchanges I&#39;d make in the future would be half Miracle Whip and half yogurt, trying plain and then lemon. For salad meal, I&#39;d add add cheese cubes, ham, chicken, summer sausage, that lonely hotdog and sunflower or pumpkin seeds. Maybe whole grain pasta.

Too bad. It sounded like something I&#39;d like.Perhaps I&#39;d like it with a different dressing. I think the dressing was a deal breaker for me.

I don&#39;t really change anything.  The only adjustment I made is that I now use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and I use skim milk instead of whole milk just because it is what we drink.  It makes a thinner soup which is fine but the original recipe is probably better but still great flavor either way.  I also quit measuring everything.

After that, I added chicken that I had baked separately and used 2% milk and 2% reduced fat cheese. I followed all of the other directions. My family loved it."

I had a problem getting my diced potatoes to consistently soften up so the next time I make it I will be sure to cook them in a separate pan and add them in at the last minute with the cheese and ham.  This was a good use of some leftover ham steak and I also had two leftover ears of sweet corn I used rather than the canned corn.  I could have used an extra ear.  My only other substitution was to use two 4 oz blocks of Velveeta cheese cubed up as I did not have shredded cheese on hand and this melts in better anyway.  It is tasty and no celery that my husband would prefer I not use!

I would then blend this soup so she could just swallow and still have the nourishment.  Now that she has passed, I always think of her when I make this as this was her favorite.

Instead of water and bullion I used chicken broth, and increased it from 1.5 cups to 4 cups (I found it just too thick at the provided ratios). I didn&#39;t have corn on hand so I upped the carrots and potatoes and also threw in a bit of diced celery, and also added a bay leaf during the saut?. And no cheddar on hand so I used gouda. I think any cheese, or mix of cheeses, would be wonderful.This is true comfort food, and I think a great &#34;base recipe&#34; for any number of variations."

I did take some hints from other reviewers by using pre-cooked bacon and some bacon grease saved in my fridge. I had frozen some homemade chicken stock,  (which I always save when I am making enchiladas or casseroles with cooked chicken) and milk in place of water and bouillon, and as I only had 2 cups cheddar when I made it the first time, I added a cup of Colby-Jack I had on hand. It was so good I decided to use the same combo again. The first time I used a whole, drained can of Niblets, and the second time a heaping cup of frozen corn, thawed. Both worked great.

The answer to your question is.. are you using cheese that is already shredded? I found this out the hard way when I was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese. If you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesn&#39;t stick together. Also you don&#34;t really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store. So freshness does matter. It is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself. Since I have been doing that, all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly. I got this tip from Paula Dean. It was a question she answered from her cooking magazine. I hope this helped you."

When it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones.  We usually use matchstick carrots so we don&#39;t have to chop.  IF we use bacon we use real bacon pieces (such as Hormel) like you can find in the salad section of the store.  We usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since I don&#39;t have bacon grease to use.  Because I use canned potatoes I only heat it through before I add the ham and cheese.  The whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers.

There was a nice balance of oats to sugar and butter and flour. The apple mixture was horribly sweet. I love sweet, but after a few bites, I had enough. My son and husband who usually pick away at the rest of the pan finished theirs, but that was it. I was ready to throw the rest away when I decided to use it as a topping for steel cut oats this morning. With a ratio of two parts oat to apple topping it was perfect with unsweetened coffee. Next time I would cut the sugar in half.  It is also a nice mix-in with Greek yogurt but as a dessert a big disappointment for such great reviews."

I&#39;ve topped the muffins before cooking with semi sweet chocolate chips, and I&#39;ve also added walnuts and semi chocolate chips right to the batter.  Tonight I realized I had run out of vanilla and substituted honey instead.  This is a great versatile recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!"

They came out like out of the bakery and I am not a good baker (but am a good cook). Also spingle a little caster sugar on top before baking and you get a sparkly top.  I also used only on over ripe banana.

I do add about 1 T of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and accidentally added a second egg --- the muffins were super moist.  I only needed about 17 minutes of baking and they were pretty dark on the outside (still looked good but not that golden color).  That could just mean my oven isn&#39;t accurate (entirely possible).

In the recipe I usually make, it has use a slightly different ratio of flour and sugar (2 c flour and 1/2 sugar) so it&#39;s the same volume of dry ingredients but the first time I made this recipe I followed it as written. I thought it would be too sweet with double sugar I&#39;m used to tasting and three sweet, ripe bananas but it wasn&#39;t too sweet at all. In fact, the person in my office who usually is most concerned with sugar content raved about these and with good reason too because they are delicious! If you want to reduce the sugar by up to half the called for amount, they are still yummy, but just remember to compensate by adding flour equal to the reduction in sugar. Personally, I&#39;m fine with 1 c sugar. The only variations I use are to sprinkle the top of each muffin with about 1/8th tsp of raw unwashed sugar before baking  because the big crystals bake a nice caramelized sugar crunch to the muffin tops. I also preheat the oven 100 degrees higher than baking temp then when I put the muffins in, drop the temp to the correct temp. I found these indeed take the full 18 min or so even with the high preheat temp. Supposedly, the high preheat temp makes them crown higher without over baking them. As a side note, parchment paper cupcake liners work the best if you have them. Thanks for reading my long review. Again, killer recipe! I&#39;ve made it several times now with great results each time. Thank you so much for a great addition to my muffin rotation!"

I also always decrease the sugar by a few tablespoons and you would never know.  Sometimes I add some shredded zucchini, by decreasing an equal amount of banana.

I added some garlic but would suggest adding some of that old bay others have suggested. I seriously can’t understand how this is award winning or how some people ended up with it being runny. After adjusting the consistency of the “sauce” I was able to create a lasagna. I added a little mozzarella to the top. My youngest son thought it was good but not great.

It is a very tasty dish but a little bit of Old Bay added a great deal to the flavor.  A little dash of lime enhanced it as welland next time I will add some garlic. It just seemed to be missing something in its purist form.   Be prepared because this recipe makes a lot of lasagna and it is very fattening and high in cholesterol.  I cut it in half and still had a lot of leftovers.  Also, I think you would be hard pressed to prepare this in 35 minutes.  Plan on at least an hour.  Lastly, get your credit card or checkbook out because it is not an inexpensive meal to make.  Once a year on special occasions or if we are having company and want to impress.

B/c of the changes I was able to make TWO lasagnas and I used the NO BOIL Lasagna! WIn-Win!!!I added a ricotta mix to make this dish like a lasagna. To my ricotta I like to add chili powder, egg, garlic powder, salt, fresh cilantro, and black pepper.  I think the chili powder help to bring out the flavor to the whole dish b/c it is a creamy dish.I did add fresh chopped garlic  when I cooked the green onions - BUT I also added and cooked 1 diced white onion tooI doubled the creamy mix b/c  I used the no boil lasagna noodles and I felt the ratio of the seafood: shrimp (cut into 3 pieces if using large shrimp (1lb), scallops (1lb), and claw crab meat (1lb) would have needed the extra sauceI did not expect to make 2, but I did.  One dish had 4 noodle layers and my other dish just had 3 noodle layers.I did noodle, ricotta, mozzarella and parmesean cheese layer, followed by seafood sauce. Then repeat the layers.  Be sure to reserve just a cup of sauce (without the seafood) for the top last layer of the lasagna. I did top that with Mozzarella too.  I didn&#39;t reserve sauce for my 2nd dish top noodle, so it was covered with the seafood. I didn&#39;t want it to burn, so that one had extra mozzarella cheese on it.Yes this is a heart attack waiting to happen, but if you are going for it, then go for it.  I wouldn&#39;t make this everyday, maybe special occasions.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made it for a potluck.  It is a little time consuming, but oh so good!!! The other dish I gave pieces away.  I only wanted 2 pieces b/c I am health conscious. But no doubt with my changes it was good.I don&#39;t measure, but I used this recipe as a guideline."

Agree with other comments - great for Christmas, or special occasion meals, as it is really rich and can be pricy. My recipe adaptations based on seafood avail. in KS: ~2.25 lbs. king crab legs* (not Alaskan), 2 lbs. sea scallops (since they were almost half as expensive as bay, and are more tender. Cut into smaller pieces.), 2lbs frozen wild salad shrimp (Costco).  Using the fresh crab was well worth it, once I was done cracking it all - the flavor was amazing! I added 6-8 roasted garlic cloves to the sauce as well. My entire family loved this lasagna, including kids and some pickier people. I will absolutely make this again! *Actually less expensive per lb. than canned crab. I also doubled the recipe as others and so glad I did.

I also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and I added the garlic just before I added the broth and juices.  I used Costco&#39;s fresh, aged parmigiano reggiano cheese.  My sauce was not bland at all!  It was thick, rich and decadent!  Also, in the doubling process, I used an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and an 8 ounce bottle of lobster juice.  Be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isn&#39;t runny.  Additionally, because mine did not brown after 38 minutes of baking, I put it under the broiler for about 2 minutes.  It was perfect!  While the seafood makes the dish costly, it was well worth it!

My recipe calls for almond extract and a little brown sugar in the dressing also but is otherwise the same.

I&#39;d never made this myself before today, though. We had a bunch of white grapes that were just a bit too tart for us to enjoy eating by themselves, so I mixed this up. It&#39;s so quick and so easy, and very forgiving of substitutions--I found that I didn&#39;t have sour cream, so used 0% plain Greek yogurt, and then discovered that I&#39;d accidentally grabbed fat free cream cheese at the store, which is a slightly different creature to me than regular or lowfat. And I had no pecans, so I chopped up some almonds. Even with all that, this came out wonderfully, and tasted very similar to what I&#39;ve had in the past at various gatherings."

I put about a cup in with the cream cheese only bc i had sugar free pb... Its still borderline too sweet tho.We used the butterfinger bits instead of the reeses too.And a little tip for the oreos... I used an already made oreo pie crust for that. It holds together better to spread the cream chesse on top.

One thing I ••didn&#39;t••do was follow the recipe to a T. when I read the ingredients it sounded way too sweet (it was going to have a cloying affect). reading all the reviews I found others thought so too after they had made it. decided to cut the powdered sugar in half. didn&#39;t add powdered sugar to the pudding either. Also a change I made was to cut some of the sweetness by adding some creme fresh  to the cream cheese. Another thing I did was melted the butter and I broke up the cookies more fine like a pie crust. I knew if I added the melted butter to the cookie crumbs I&#39;d be able to pat it better into the bottom of my container. I put it in the refrigerator overnight because I plan on serving this to my coworkers for the next few days. also omitted putting the cookie chunks and/or the minI peanut butter cups on top because I didn&#39;t know how well it would travel on a plane and the top treats would just get squashed plus seemed like overkill.my husband was able to just have one bite last night (and a small bite at that) because his stomach was on fire from Mexican restaurant  we went to for dinner. he did say this was very good. I actually think I&#39;ll make this several more times. I wish I would&#39;ve known about it last weekend at our 3yr old&#39;s birthday party but I didn&#39;t. all in all I think this is a hit.dinged a point because of original recipe being too sweet for our taste as written plus additions&amp;subtractions.PS....UPDATE: July 1stmade it again yesterday for a neighbor who is having a 1st time swim/pool filling up party tonight. I use the 5.9oz pudding mix because I want to make it a large dessert for this US celebration weekend party. I crushed &#39;chocolate colored rock candy&#39; on top for color (from WinCo bulk dept). I won&#39;t be here for the party tonight, but hope it will be enjoyed. (ask if you care to know how I changed this recipe to suit our tastes, happy to oblige)."

I also thickened it with a slurry of flour and water. It turned out delicious. The only thing I would do differently is leave out the onion.

I&#39;ve reduced the sugar and the oil by half and also the eggs to only two (sometimes only 1) .I also use up any any amount of pumpkin that I have no matter if it&#39;s only 1 cup or 2 or even a full can. Makes no difference as it always turns out delicious.

I did take one reviewer’s advice and used the whole can of pumpkin and omitted the water. I also didn’t use cloves because I don’t like the flavor of them. Baked for 75 min in a glass pan and it came out perfectly. It is wonderful with a pat of butter while still warm. Will definitely make this again!

Used standard cane sugar and some maple syrup, and subbed all baking powder for the baking soda. Still turned out fantastic. One thing I love about this recipe is that it uses 1/2c water instead if just going for the 1 entire cup of canola oil, as less healthier recipes do. Would also try adding 1 or 2 teaspoons of vanilla next time. Forget canned pumpkin and used fresh if you can, it makes a world of difference!"

My husband felt like it needed more tortillas than the three used for the layers.  I might try doubling next time.

Try medium.  Not too hot and definately more flavor than tomatoes.  About the sodium content by I reviewer. Try making your own .  There are Lots of recipes online  but basically 1 T. Each :cumin, chilli powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and a scant TOregano. (1/4t. salt is optional. )  I round up the cumin just a bit and go a bit scant one the chili powder .But a mix of regular and  chipolte chilli powder  is good too. That will taste just like the envelope or BETTER according to reviews  Plus no sodium. Also look for fat free refried beans... 85 % lean or ground turkey (needs a tad more seasoning) lowers the fat.  These swaps do not chang the flavor at all. ADD in stuff  include corn., jalapenos . Olives. .

However, I made a few changes right off the bat. My current changes were: I used whole wheat flour tortillas, venison burger (about 1 1/2 pounds), TWO packets of taco seasoning. 4 cups (2- 8oz bags) of shredded Mexican cheese. We also added sour cream and guacamole as a garnish.Things I will do differently next time I make it: I will use sliced GREEN onions in beef mixture AND as a garnish. I will use a tub of fresh salsa instead of Mexican diced tomatoes, and when I do that I will delete the 2/3 cup water, because fresh salsa has way more juice than a can of diced tomatoes. And I would definitely break up the top layer of tortilla&#39;s and spread them evenly, cuz those were tough to cut. I had to perforate them with a sharp knife to get an even cut. Even sprinkled with cheese and baked they were not soft enough to cut pieces with the spatula.Other than my changes, this was an awesome first time recipe for us and we liked it!"

UPDATE 5/2/2014:  I make this dish on a regular basis, still a family favorite.  However, this recipe fills a 9x13 casserole dish which is a little too much for us to eat in a couple of days.  What I&#39;ve started doing is mixing all of the filling together - ground beef, onion, pepper, water, taco seasoning, black beans and diced tomatoes - I also started mixing in the refried beans so it&#39;s simpler to put together and the taste is the same :-)  Then I divide the entire recipe in half.  I use 3 tortillas, half the filling and half the cheese and make up a 8x8 dish.  Then I take the remaining half of just the filling and freeze it in a freezer container.

You will be very surprised at the differences of volume.  Example one cup of flour is 4-1/4 ounces, bisquick, and bread flour is also 4-1/4 ounces per cup. A large banana is approx 4.8 ounces...1/4 cup of brown sugar is 2.0 ounces, same for granulated...Just a few examples.  Over the years we have used way too much ingredients that changed the recipe..hence the differences of people’s results.  Happy  Baking everyone????????"

What a hit!  They were moist and delicious and many came back for seconds and thirds. The recipe was simple and a good choice.

The frosting came out REALLY runny. I even added more powdered sugar and it didn&#39;t help. After reading the other reviews I might try it again but cut the whole recipe in 1/2 so if it doesn&#39;t work out I won&#39;t be throwing away as much food and money I did this time. I&#39;ll probably lower the temp to 325° and let it bake a few more minutes.

I was short cream cheese for the frosting, and forgot the vanila, and it STILL CAME OUT GREAT!  Very cake-like and moist, awesome banana flavor, a go-to recipe to take to a gathering!"
